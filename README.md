# Database management API & Web application front-end for OSRIC players & DMs
Using _FastAPI (Python)_, _mongo db (with `pymongo`)_, and _Next-JS (React)_

## Getting Started

*Pre-requisites:*
- Docker & `docker-compose`

1. Clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Sparrow1029/DnDdb.git
```
2. Build the application containers with docker-compose
```bash
$ cd DnDdb
$ dcomp up -d --build
```

---

### Mongo
For the time being there is not a command to initialize the data for the database, so it will have to create it manually:
```bash
$ pip3 install pymongo  # make sure to have pymongo installed, in a virtualenv or otherwise
$ cd raw_data
$ python3 init_db.py
```

The above should populate the database with the data that is currently transposed from the [OSRIC PDF](https://www.osricrpg.com/files/OSRIC.pdf).

The mongodb container should be running on localhost:27017

*\*NOTE:* If you would like to interact with the mongodb from the CLI or with an application like [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) the default connection string/URL for mongo is `mongodb://dnd_admin:eulalia@localhost:27017`


### Fast API
To view the *Swagger* documentation generated by Fast API, visit `http://localhost:8002/docs` in a web browser.

Creating a user & characters can be done using Postman (\*recommended)

(too lazy to post how to do it with `curl` right now lol)

### Next-JS/React webapp
Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser to see the current state of the NextJS act (_VERY MUCH_ still in early days...)
