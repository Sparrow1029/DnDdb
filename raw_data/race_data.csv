dwarf,"Dwarfs are a short and burly race, living in mountain fastnesses underground. They are loyal friends and fierce adversaries, known for their steadfastness in all things.\n\n The dwarfs are inherently resistant to many spells and spell-like effects. Dwarfish characters gain bonuses against the use of most magic, including all spells, wands, rods, and staves. The amount of the bonus depends upon the dwarfâ€™s constitution: every 3.5 points of constitution (rounding down fractions) grants a bonus of +1 against such magic. Moreover, the hardy dwarfish nature imparts a similar bonus on any saving throws against poison.\n\n Dwarfs are not a numerous folk, but they are adventurous, loving the lustre of gold, the glitter of gems, and the quality of well-wrought metals. Dwarfs can live to an age of 350 years or more.

elf,"Elves are thinner and generally smaller in stature than humans.  The elves have a powerful bond with nature and do not have souls; their thinking and motives are quite alien to those of humankind, and in any dealings with elves, it is perilous to forget this.\n\n Some elven clans have built elaborate civilisations, remote and beautiful places of profound learning, master craftsmanship, and long history. Such elves tend to be chaotic good in alignment and friendly, if aloof, from humans. More numerous are the wilder elves, predominantly chaotic neutral in alignment and often not friendly to other races, inclining even toward hostility.\n\n Intruding into the territory of such elves is inadvisable, for their sense of humour with regard to humans is, at best, arbitrary and, at worst, cruel. Different as they are, these varied elven cultures all share the same racial abilities, unless the GM chooses otherwise. Elves can live to an age of 1,000 years or more.

gnome,"Gnomes are small folk imbued with the wilding power of illusion and misdirection. They are inveterate burrowers, often seeking hilly lands where gems and precious metals may be found. On average, they are shorter and slimmer of build than dwarfs, with larger noses and longer beards.\n\n Like dwarfs, who are perhaps related to gnomes from some time in the distant and mythical past, gnomes are quite resistant to magic and sensitive to the nuances of construction.  Gnomes can live to an age of 650 years or more.

half_elf,"It is possible for elves and humans to interbreed, although elven fastidiousness makes this a fairly uncommon occurrence.

halfling,"Halflings are a small and unprepossessing race, often living near human settlements at an agreeable remove from the bustle and hurriedness characteristic of humans. Halfling society is comfortable and staid, rooted in polite, placid, well-fed life.  Halfling adventurers are thought aberrant, even lunatic, but also dashing and heroic figures, a charming and amusing contradiction of logic.\n\n Halflings value learning and craftsmanship, as long as nothing is taken to an embarrassing extreme. They are capable of moving very quietly and are excellent marksmen; given the right personality, halflings can become excellent thieves. Halflings live to be 150 or more years old.","{""bonuses"": {""base stats"": ""-1 Str, +1 Dex"", ""saving throw bonus"": ""+1 bonus per 3.5 points of Con to saves against magic (both aimed magic items and spells) and poison"", ""hit bonus"": ""+3 bonus to attacks with a bow or sling"" }, ""infravision"": ""60 ft"", ""movement"": ""90 ft"", ""surprise"": ""4 in 6 chance to surprise when travelling in non-metal armour and alone, or more than 90 ft in advance of others, or with a party entirely consisting of elves and/or halflings.

half_orc,"The progeny of human/orc breeding are normally indistinguishable from orcs. However, a few are sufficiently human to gain levels in a character class, although they are severely limited in classes that do not focus upon violence and death.\n\n Orcish blood runs strong in these half-breeds, and most of them are shifty, morally questionable, and unsophisticated. They are typically ugly, carrying the mark of orcish ancestry, but the same ancestry makes them deadly adversaries when the chips are down and the swords are out. Half-orcs can live to be 70 years old or older.  ","{""bonuses"": {""base stats"": ""+1 Str and Con, -2 Cha""}} ",common orcish,assassin cleric fighter thief
human,"Humans are the standard for the game, and as such, humans have no unusual abilities or limitations in game terms. Because of their potential for unlimited progression in all the character classes save assassin and druid, humans are a popular choice for most players. This is an intentional feature of the rules.\n\n A common house rule in OSRIC-compatible games is the adjustment or removal of demi-human level limits. This will unbalance the game in favour of demi-humans unless humans are given some corresponding advantage. GMs considering such a house rule for their own OSRIC-compatible games are advised to ensure that in most campaigns, humans should still represent an attractive choice for their players.","{""bonuses"": null}",common,assassin cleric druid fighter illustionist magic_user paladin ranger thief
