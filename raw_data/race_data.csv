dwarf,"Dwarfs are a short and burly race, living in mountain fastnesses underground. They are loyal friends and fierce adversaries, known for their steadfastness in all things.\n\n The dwarfs are inherently resistant to many spells and spell-like effects. Dwarfish characters gain bonuses against the use of most magic, including all spells, wands, rods, and staves. The amount of the bonus depends upon the dwarfâ€™s constitution: every 3.5 points of constitution (rounding down fractions) grants a bonus of +1 against such magic. Moreover, the hardy dwarfish nature imparts a similar bonus on any saving throws against poison.\n\n Dwarfs are not a numerous folk, but they are adventurous, loving the lustre of gold, the glitter of gems, and the quality of well-wrought metals. Dwarfs can live to an age of 350 years or more.

elf,"Elves are thinner and generally smaller in stature than humans.  The elves have a powerful bond with nature and do not have souls; their thinking and motives are quite alien to those of humankind, and in any dealings with elves, it is perilous to forget this.\n\n Some elven clans have built elaborate civilisations, remote and beautiful places of profound learning, master craftsmanship, and long history. Such elves tend to be chaotic good in alignment and friendly, if aloof, from humans. More numerous are the wilder elves, predominantly chaotic neutral in alignment and often not friendly to other races, inclining even toward hostility.\n\n Intruding into the territory of such elves is inadvisable, for their sense of humour with regard to humans is, at best, arbitrary and, at worst, cruel. Different as they are, these varied elven cultures all share the same racial abilities, unless the GM chooses otherwise. Elves can live to an age of 1,000 years or more.

halfling,"Halflings are a small and unprepossessing race, often living near human settlements at an agreeable remove from the bustle and hurriedness characteristic of humans. Halfling society is comfortable and staid, rooted in polite, placid, well-fed life.  Halfling adventurers are thought aberrant, even lunatic, but also dashing and heroic figures, a charming and amusing contradiction of logic.\n\n Halflings value learning and craftsmanship, as long as nothing is taken to an embarrassing extreme. They are capable of moving very quietly and are excellent marksmen; given the right personality, halflings can become excellent thieves.

human,"Humans are the standard for the game, and as such, humans have no unusual abilities or limitations in game terms. Because of their potential for unlimited progression in all the character classes save assassin and druid, humans are a popular choice for most players. This is an intentional feature of the rules.\n\n A common house rule in OSRIC-compatible games is the adjustment or removal of demi-human level limits. This will unbalance the game in favour of demi-humans unless humans are given some corresponding advantage.
