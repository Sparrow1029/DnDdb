cleric,Aerial Servant ,6,10 ft,1 day/ caster lvl,See text,v s,9 segments,none,"By casting this spell, the cleric summons an aerial servant to do his or her bidding. The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth. When fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.",
cleric,Animate Dead ,3,10 ft,Permanent,See text,v s m,1 round,none,"By casting this spell, the cleric calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confi nes of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level.",
cleric,Animate Object ,6,30 ft,1 round/caster lvl,1 cubic ft/caster lvl,v s,9 segments,none,"By means of this spell, the cleric “brings to life” an inanimate object, allowing it to move and follow the cleric’s simple commands. The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/ round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.",
cleric,Astral Spell,7,Touch,See text,See text,v s,3 turns,none,"Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form. Most magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.",
cleric,Atonement ,5,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),1 person,v s m,1 turn,none,"The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.",
cleric,Augury,2,Caster,Instantaneous,Caster,v s m,2 rounds,none,"Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.",
cleric,Blade Barrier,6,30 ft,3 rounds/caster lvl,Circular path 2-10 ft in radius,v s,9 segments,none,"This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).",
cleric,Bless,1,60 ft,6 rounds,50 x 50 ft,v s m,1 round,none,"This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with -5% morale and -1 to hit.
The spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).",
cleric,Chant,2,0,Indefinite (duration of chant),30 ft radius centered around the caster,v s,1 turn,none,"Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a -1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.",
cleric,Command,1,10 ft,1 round,1 living creature,v,1 segment,See text,"By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”. Creatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.",
cleric,Commune,5,Caster,3 rounds (limited number of questions),See text,v s m,1 turn,none,"The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.",
cleric,Conjure Animals,6,30 ft,2 rounds/caster lvl,Conjured Creatures,v s,9 segments,none,"A cleric may use this spell to conjure animal allies from thin air and order them into combat. The total hit dice of summoned animals cannot exceed the cleric’s level, and the animals must all be of the same type. This spell will only summon mammals, although giant or prehistoric forms of normal mammals may be conjured if these are present within a few miles of the caster. The GM determines the specific type of animal that appears.",
cleric,Continual Light,3,120 ft,Permanent,60 ft radius globe,v s,6 segments,See text,"This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost sufficient to rival the light of day. In some respects the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light, but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a light spell,

extending 60 ft into the darkness. The reverse of the spell, continual darkness, produces an ink-like darkness in the same 60 ft area and negates the illumination of a continual light spell if one is present.
By casting the spell upon an enemy’s eyes or other organs of sight, the caster may blind the spell’s subject, causing the same penalties as if the creature were blinded by a light spell. In this instance, a saving throw is permitted, and if it is successful the spell’s effect will centre upon the area immediately behind the targeted creature.",
cleric,Control Weather,7,0,4d12 hours,4d4 square miles,v s m,1 turn,none,"The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather for several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather. This spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.",
cleric,Create Food and Water,3,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),A day’s ration per caster level,v s,1 turn,none,"Upon completion of the ritual words of this spell, food and/ or water will appear from thin air. A caster of fifth level can conjure up enough food and water to sustain a person or even a horse for five full days. The volume of food and water produced by the spell is approximately one cubic ft per level of the caster.",
cleric,Create Water,1,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),Up to 30 cubic ft,v s m,1 round,none,"This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water.",
cleric,Cure Blindness,3,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 round,none (Neg.),"This powerful spell allows the cleric permanently to remove virtually all forms of blindness. The reverse of the spell permits a saving throw, and the cleric must successfully touch the spell’s intended target to inflict blindness (permanent duration).",
cleric,Cure Critical Wounds,5,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,8 segments,none (Neg.),"This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of
damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.
",
cleric,Cure Disease,3,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 turn,none (Neg.),"By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.
",
cleric,Cure Light Wounds,1,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,5 segments,none (Neg.),"Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.",
cleric,Cure Serious Wounds,4,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),one creature,v s,7 segments,none (Neg.),"A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.",
cleric,Detect Charm,2,30 ft,1 turn,See text,v s,1 round,none,"This spell reveals to the cleric whether a creature is subject to a charm spell. The spell’s magic can discern a charm (or lack thereof) on up to ten creatures. The reverse of the spell conceals the existence of a charm, but affects only one creature.",
cleric,Detect Evil,1,Caster,1 turn + 5 rounds/lvl,"path 10 ft wide, 120 ft long",v s m,1 round,none,"This spell allows the cleric to discern emanations of evil (or good, in the case of the spell’s reverse) within the spell’s area of effect, a beam-like pathway. The spell detects evil, not danger, so it will be useless to discover such things as a mindless trap or a poisoned wineglass. Neither will it detect a cursed item unless the nature of the curse is such that the cursed item becomes inherently evil. ",
cleric,Detect Lie,4,30 ft,1 round/ caster lvl,One person,v s m,7 segments,none,"The subject of this spell (not necessarily the caster) gains the ability to discern whether the truth is being told, for the duration of the spell. The reverse of the spell allows the spell recipient’s most brazen falsehoods to seem logical and believable. The spell’s reverse may also be used to ward against the effects of a detect lie spell.",
cleric,Detect Magic,1,Caster,1 turn,"path 10 ft wide, 30 ft long",v s m,1 round,none,"Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.",
cleric,Dispel Evil,5,Touch,1 round/caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,8 segments,See text,"This spell banishes summoned creatures of evil, or those summoned for evil purposes, to their home planes of existence. Although a saving throw negates the spell’s banishing effect, any creature that would otherwise have been banished will suffer a penalty of -7 to hit the caster for the extent of the spell’s duration. Creatures affected by this spell include, but are certainly not limited to, afreets, demons, devils, genies (either evil or working toward evil purposes under duress), and elementals summoned for evil purposes. The reverse of the spell has the same effects, but upon summoned creatures of good alignment or those summoned for the purposes of good.",
cleric,Dispel Magic,3,60 ft,Instantaneous,30 ft radius sphere,v s,6 segments,none,"Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become nonoperational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility) will be dispelled.

With respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area. ",
cleric,Divination,4,Caster,See text,Caster,v s m,1 turn,none,"A divination spell gives the caster divine insight about a particular place, examples being a ruined castle, a particular region in a dungeon, or a small vale. The location of the place must be known to the cleric (e.g., the “Red Mausoleum,” if a legendary location, cannot be the focus of the spell, but if the cleric has seen the doorway of the tomb, the spell will be effective). The spell yields rich information compared to an augury, although it may be couched in rather vague and approximate terms.

The spell reveals the relative power of the creatures in the area, the treasure (“low,” “moderate,” or “rich”), and chances of incurring the wrath of gods or similar beings if the place is disturbed. There is a chance that the cleric will fail to interpret the omens properly; the base chance to succeed in gaining truthful information is 60%, and rises by another 1% per caster level. The chance may also be adjusted by the GM as necessary.

If the cleric’s reading of the omens is not correct, of course, he or she will be operating on completely false and useless “insights.” The casting of a divination spell is quite dramatic, involving the sacrifice of a dove or other such creature appropriate to the religion in question. Valuable items may also be sacrificed, and such may increase the chance of the cleric receiving clear omens that are easily interpreted.",
cleric,Earthquake,7,120 ft,1 round,5 ft diameter/lvl,v s m,1 turn,none,"The cleric invokes a small but intensely powerful earthquake within this spell’s area of effect. The spell may be used to create landslides, drain marshes, cave in tunnels, and collapse buildings. Yawning cracks in the earth have a good chance to swallow creatures in the area: the chance of falling into such a crevice (by creature size) is 1 in 4 (small), 1 in 6 (medium) and 1 in 8 (large). Being swallowed up in such fashion is, of course, fatal. Trees standing in the area of an earthquake spell have a 1 in 3 chance of being uprooted.",
cleric,Exorcise,4,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),One creature or object,v s m,See text,none,"Exorcism is a powerful abjuration that casts out demons, devils, or any supernatural inhabitant or influence from a creature or object that has been possessed or otherwise controlled. Exorcism banishes all charms and enchantments, removes curses, and will cast any possessing demon or other creature back into its nearest physical body other than the one being exorcised. The base chance for the cleric to perform a successful exorcism is randomly determined on a d% if the GM has not previously assigned a specific number to represent the relative diffi culty of the exorcism. To the base chance is added a modifier of +1/-1 for each level of difference between the cleric’s caster level and the level or hit dice of the opposing supernatural force (determined by the GM in the case of supernatural forces with no stated level or HD). The cleric begins the exorcism, rolling a d% for each turn. If the cleric’s die roll is equal to or less than the modified chance of success, the exorcism is successful. The process cannot be halted once it has begun, and if the cleric is forced to pause before successfully casting out the supernatural force, the spell will fail.",

cleric,Find the Path,6,Touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,3 rounds,none,"This spell imbues one creature with an uncanny sense for the shortest route into or out of a chosen locale. The spell imparts only a visceral intuition of the right direction and shortest distance, so it is impossible to use the spell either to circumvent dangers or to draw a map. This spell may be used to escape from a maze spell (q.v.) in one round and will continue to function thereafter. The spell’s reverse makes a creature unable to make any significant movement beyond aimless wandering.",

Each creature caught within the flames will suffer 6d8 points of damage, halved if the creature makes a successful saving throw.",
cleric,Gate,7,30 ft,See text,One summoned creature,v s,5 segments,none,"A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and Irascible.",
cleric,Glyph of Warding,3,Touch,permanent (until discharged),25 square ft/ caster level,v s m,See text,See text,"The glyph of warding is a magically charged sigil or rune, scribed and enchanted to serve as the focal point of a powerful magical trap. The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, floor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defining what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics. The GM must determine what glyphs may be within the capabilities of such formidable individuals.",
cleric,Heal,6,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 round,none (Neg.),"This spell affects the same general variety of creatures as the cure light wounds spell (q.v.), but it is necromancy on an entirely different level than the various cure spells. Heal removes all hit point damage with the exception of the last 1d4 points, removes blindness, cures disease, and will negates the effects of a feeblemind spell.

The cleric decides how many of his or her foes he or she will target with the spell. If there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –2; if two, each makes the saving throw at –1; and if the cleric seeks to hold three enemies, each makes its saving throw with no penalty. If a magic item or spell operates partially to negate the effects of paralysis, failing the save will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. Creatures affected by this spell include humans, demi-humans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. Persons held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.",

When the cleric utters the final words of the incantation, this focal point belches forth a massive cloud of stinging insects, which boils outward almost instantly to fill the spell’s area of effect. Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force, etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point.

The caster may extinguish the magical light at any time. The reverse of the spell, darkness, creates an area of utter darkness just as the light spell creates light, with the only distinction being that the darkness spell has half the duration of a light spell. If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense.

It is not necessary for the caster to have seen the precise object that the spell will locate: if the caster is familiar with ladders in general, he or she may cast the spell successfully to locate any ladder within the spell’s range. The spell is directional, requiring the cleric to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The cleric may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.)

Despite its name, the spell’s power is not limited to water; it can affect other non-living fl uid substances as well, including gases and materials slightly more viscous than water. The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the cleric. For example, a cleric of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 x 70 ft. The reverse of the spell raises water in an area of effect similar to that of lower water , but not to the same degree of height, returning water to its natural level plus one foot per caster level.",

An unwilling victim must be touched by the cleric in order for the cleric to send him or her to another plane, and a saving throw is also applicable. The casting of a plane shift spell provides one-way travel to the other plane; a second casting of the spell (or a similar spell of planar travel) is required in order to make the return journey.

The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extra-planar creatures regardless of alignment.

cleric,Raise Dead,5,30 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),one person,v s,1 round,See text,"The eerie, keening incantation of this spell calls a soul back from the afterlife, literally bringing the dead back to life. Elves, as they do not have souls, cannot be brought back to life in this manner, but humans, half-elves, half-orcs, gnomes, dwarfs, and halflings can all be raised from the dead by means of this spell. The longer a soul has been departed from the material plane, the more difficult it is to call it back; a cleric can summon back a soul that has been dead no more days than the cleric’s level. In other words, a cleric of tenth level can raise a person who has been dead no more than ten days, but an eleventh level cleric can raise a person who has been dead eleven days. The raised person must survive a system shock saving throw in order to return to life, and he or she will be unable to engage in strenuous activity (such as combat, study, or spell casting) for a period of time equal to one day for each day that he or she was dead.

Perhaps mercifully, the spell erases the returning character’s memory concerning any places his or her soul may have visited following death.

Raise dead can instantly destroy most kinds of corporeal undead creatures (exception: it does not destroy liches). Incorporeal undead, such as ghosts or spectres, are immune. This use is treated the same as the reverse of the spell in terms of saving throws and damage.

The reverse of the spell is referred to in hushed tones as slay living. The subject of this spell (which must be used with extreme caution by good clerics, lest their alignment be altered) is entitled to a saving throw, and if the throw fails, the subject dies.

The spell’s reverse, bestow curse, inflicts the subject with a magical curse, the exact nature of which is not entirely within the caster’s control.

With the GM’s agreement, the character may design a specifi c curse to use with this spell other than the random curse the spell normally unleashes.

Not necessarily all lost experience points are restored; an afflicted character will only regain enough experience points to regain the lost level, no more. A cleric can only restore a level lost within as many days as the cleric’s caster level. For example, a cleric of 12th level cannot restore an experience level lost 13 or more days prior to the casting of the spell. The spell’s reverse causes the target to lose one experience level. No saving throw applies, but a successful attack is required. In addition to restoring lost levels, the spell can affect other sorts of magically-induced debilities.

It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power.

druid,Conjure Earth Elemental,7,40 ft,1 turn/ lvl,-,v s m,1 turn,none,"By means of this spell, the druid summons a 16 HD elemental from the plane of earth. The spell is otherwise identical to the druidic spell conjure fire elemental, but there is no chance to summon a more powerful elemental, as exists when a druid summons fire elementals. As with conjuring fire elementals, the earth elemental will be the druid’s ally by its own will; the druid requires no magical wards against it and need not concentrate upon it after the summoning is complete.",
druid,Conjure Fire Elemental,6,80 ft,1 turn/ caster lvl,-,v s m,6 rounds,none,"It is within the power of a high-level druid to summon forth an elemental being from the plane of fire. The elemental will ordinarily be of 16 HD, but there is a 5% chance that it will be of 24 HD and a 1% chance that an afreet, rather than an elemental, will appear. The elemental will act as the druid’s ally, remaining for the spell’s duration to assist him or her however possible, including engaging in combat with his or her enemies. Druids need no protective circle to summon fire elementals and need not concentrate upon the elemental in any way.",
druid,Control Temperature 10 ft radius,4,caster,4 turns + 1 turn/ lvl,10 ft radius,v s m,6 segments,none,"By casting this spell, the druid magically controls the temperature of his or her immediate surroundings, to a radius of 10 ft. The temperature may be raised or lowered by 9° Fahrenheit (4° Celsius) per caster level.",
druid,Control Weather,7,0,8d12 hours,4d8 sq miles,v s m,1 turn,none,"The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather of several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell, but druids are able to cause more of a change than druids can with the same spell; effectively twice the amount of change is possible for a druid. The druid could not bring heavy rain forth on a clear day, but could change the weather from clear to partly cloudy, and then to fully cloudy (with light rain, perhaps), all in the course of one casting. By comparison, a druid would only have been able to bring about partial clouds. Hot weather can be made cool, and a strong wind can be raised from calm air. This spell may be cast more than once in succession to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a strong wind, then from the strong wind to a full-scale storm.",
druid,Control Winds,5,caster,1 turn/ caster lvl,40 ft radius/ lvl,v s m,7 segments,none,"By the power of this spell, the druid can increase or decrease the force of the winds. For every caster level, the druid may change the speed of the wind by 3 miles per hour. An eye of calm with a radius of 40 ft remains around the druid and travels with him or her. The wind force increases (or decreases) at a rate of 3 miles per hour every round until the end of the spell’s duration, at which time it will return to normal, also at a rate of 3 miles per hour per turn. Winds can be extremely destructive; ships are at great risk of sinking if wind speed reaches 60 miles per hour, and wind speeds of 75+ mph are as a full-fledged hurricane.",
druid,Create Water,2,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),up to 1 ft cu/ lvl,v s,1 turn,none,"This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see.",
druid,Creeping Doom,7,0,4 rounds/ lvl,,v s m,9 segments,none,"The terrifying creeping doom spell causes a massive swarm of insects, spiders, and centipedes to boil forth from the ground in front of the caster, marching in whatever direction he or she orders, destroying and killing all that stands in their way. The swarm is composed of (1d6+4) x100 non-flying vermin, each of which inflicts 1 hp damage against an opponent before dying. Only as many insects as are needed to kill an opponent will die, and once the target is dead the swarm will move on. If the druid allows the swarm to get more than 80 ft away from his or her person, 50 insects for every 10 ft beyond this range will depart the swarm. The druid can order the swarm to attack specific targets and/or to change direction. Although the spell can be devastating (potentially causing as much as 1,000 hp of damage in total), many means can be used to counter it—the most obvious being a fireball or other area-of-effect damage spell.",
druid,Cure Critical Wounds,6,touch,instantaneous (permanent),one creature,v s m,8 segments,none,"This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.",
druid,Cure Disease,3,touch,instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s m,1 round,none (neg.),"By means of this spell, the druid may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the druid successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.",
druid,Cure Light Wounds,2,touch,instantaneous (permanent),creature touched,v s m,4 segments,none (neg.),"Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.",
druid,Cure Serious Wounds,4,touch,instantaneous (permanent),creature touched,v s m,6 segments,none (neg.),"A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.",
druid,Detect Magic,1,caster,12 rounds,"path 10 ft wide, 40 ft long",v s m,3 segments,none,"Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.",
druid,Detect Pits and Snares,1,caster,4 rounds/ lvl,"path 10 ft wide, 40 ft long",v s m,3 segments,none,"The druid may cast this spell upon himor herself, imbuing his or her eyes with divinatory power. The druid can instantly discern virtually any form of trap if outdoors, and even indoors or underground he or she will detect the presence of pits.",
druid,Dispel Magic,4,80 ft,instantaneous,40 ft cu/ lvl,v s m,6 segments,none,"Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become nonoperational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility) will be dispelled. With respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area.",
druid,Entangle,1,80 ft,1 turn,20 ft radius,v s m,3 segments,Half (see desc),"The druid casts this spell upon a particular spot, whereupon all plants in a 20 ft radius of the enchanted location immediately begin to writhe violently about, whipping around and entangling any creature in the area. Creatures threatened in this manner are entitled to a saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature’s movement rate is slowed to half normal; if the saving throw fails, the creature is so securely held in the plants that it cannot move, attack, or cast spells for the duration of the spell.",
druid,Faerie Fire,1,80 ft,4 rounds/ caster lvl,1 size M or 2 size S creatures/ caster lvl,v,3 segments,none,"The druid uses this spell to ignite a fiery-looking aura of bright light around his or her enemies. The aura is visible at a range of 80 ft if the observer stands in darkness, and at 40 ft if he or she stands near another light source. The light itself is harmless, but a creature limned with faerie fire is easier to hit; any attacks against it are made with a bonus of +2.",
druid,Feeblemind,6,40 ft,permanent,one creature,v s,8 segments,negates,"The insidious feeblemind spell affects only those who can cast spells, tracing and poisoning the mystical channels of their arcane power like a viral infection. The spell reduces a victim into a state of extreme mental retardation, which condition persists until the victim is magically restored by means of a heal, wish, or restoration spell. The different types of spell casting ability are not equally vulnerable to the feeblemind spell. Practitioners of clerical magic gain a bonus of +1 to saving throws; druids save at –1; magic users and illusionists save at –4. (Those who can use more than one type of magic must save using the average of their modifiers.)",
druid,Feign Death,2,10 ft,4 rounds + 2 rounds/ lvl,one creature,v s m,3 segments,none,"This spell magically slows the recipient’s metabolism into a state so close to death that it is impossible to distinguish the enspelled person from a corpse by any means other than magical. The recipient can hear, smell, and think; the senses of touch and sight no longer function. Damage caused to the pseudocorpse is reduced by one half, and the spell’s recipient will not even know that the damage has been caused—potentially a dangerous situation. A person under the influence of this spell is not subject to level draining by the undead and will not be affected by poisons until the spell wears off or is otherwise removed; the caster can remove the catalepsy at will, and the spell is subject to being dispelled.",
druid,Finger of Death,7,60 ft,instantaneous,one creature,v s m,5 segments,negates,"The casting of this spell culminates when the druid points a finger at his or her chosen victim. If the target fails a saving throw, it dies.",
druid,Fire Seeds,6,40 ft (see text),1 turn/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,1 round/ seed,half,"By casting this spell upon a group of seeds, either acorns or holly berries, the druid imbues them with the potential to erupt in a violent explosion of magical fire. Transformed acorns may be used as missiles, and transformed holly berries as delayed-action bombs. The spell allows the druid to create four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds, or a proportionate combination such as two acorns and four holly berries. Acorns may be thrown at a range of up to 40 ft and cause 2d8 points of damage in a radius of 5 ft, igniting any combustibles that fail item saving throws. If an acorn strikes its target with a successful to-hit roll, the target is not entitled to a saving throw. Even if the attack misses, the target may be caught in the blast area (and would be entitled to a saving throw for half damage, as any other creature within the blast area). The holly berries may be thrown no more than 6 ft, or may be left in place to ignite upon a command word. (The range of the command word is 40 ft.) Holly berries create an explosion in an area of 5 x 5 ft, inflicting 1d8 points of damage and causing combustible items to make saving throws against magical fire or burn. As with the acorn seeds, a successful saving throw against the explosion of a holly berry fire seed reduces the damage inflicted by one-half.",
druid,Fire Storm,7,150 ft,1 round,20 x 20 x 20 ft area/ caster lvl,v s m,9 segments,half,"The fire storm invocation is a modified and enlarged version of wall of fire. It lasts for only a single round, and does only half the damage of a wall of fire (i.e. 2d8 damage), but the huge area of effect makes it devastating. The spell’s reverse extinguishes all normal fire in the area of effect, or will instantly kill one fire elemental (no saving throw).",
druid,Fire Trap,2,touch,permanent until tripped,one object,v s m,1 turn,Half,"This spell enchants any item that can be opened or closed with a magical trap. When the item is opened by any person other than the caster, magical fire explodes in an area five ft in radius around the fire trapped object, causing 1d4 plus the caster’s level hit points of damage to all creatures in this area. A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion. Detecting a fire trap is extraordinarily difficult; attempts to find traps are reduced by one-half in efficacy if the trap is a fire trap, and the trap will detonate if an attempt to remove traps fails.",
druid,Hallucinatory Forest,4,touch,instantaneous,3 cu ft + 1/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"The magic user moulds stone by the power of his or her will, shaping it into whatever object or form he or she desires, from a weapon to a sculpture to an ornate stone footstool. Whether used to decorate the wizard’s tower with gargoyles or to make an escape hole from a stone prison, this spell is extremely versatile and useful.",
druid,Heat Metal,2,40 ft,7 rounds,"All metal worn by 1 size M creature per caster lvl, or 50lbs weight/ caster lvl, as applicable",v s m,4 segments,none,"This extremely powerful spell causes metal to heat up to searing temperatures, and the reverse, chill metal, causes metal to become damagingly cold. The two versions of the spell inflict different damage and potential side effects.

druid,Hold Animal,3,0,2 rounds/ caster lvl,1d4 animals,v s m,5 segments,negates,"By means of this spell the druid holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, or reptiles, but not monsters such as centaurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. That is, apes, bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant beavers, and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for 2 melee rounds per level of experience of the druid casting it. It is up to the druid as to how many animals he or she wishes to hold with the spell, but the greater the number, the better chance each will have of not being affected by the spell. Note that a maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds with respect to non-mammals)/animal/level of experience of the druid can be affected, i.e. an 8th level druid can affect up to four 3,200 pound mammals or a like number of 800 pound non-mammals such as birds or reptiles. Each animal gets a saving throw: if only 1 is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its die roll to save; if 2 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -2 on their die rolls; if 3 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -1 on their die rolls; if 4 are subject, each makes a normal saving throw.",
druid,Hold Plant,4,80 ft,1 round/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,6 segments,negates,"This spell affects plants that can move, whether naturally or as the result of a spell. Plants affected by the spell are frozen in place for the spell’s duration, and if the spell is cast upon normal vegetation (such as dry leaves), these will make no sound other than sounds caused by the wind. In the case of moulds, fungi, and other plants that cannot be considered separately, the spell affects 4-16 square yards of space, as decided by the druid. In the case of plant creatures such as treants, the spell affects between one and four creatures, at the caster’s option. Depending upon how many creatures (or sq yards of space) the druid targets, the saving throw against the spell is subject to different penalties. If one creature (4 sq yards) is targeted, the saving throw against the spell is made at a penalty of –4; two creatures or 8 sq yards suffer a penalty of –2; three creatures or 12 sq yards suffer a penalty of –1; and four creatures or 16 sq yards suffer no penalty on the saving throw.",
druid,Insect Plague,5,320 ft,1 turn/ caster lvl,"cloud of 160 ft radius, 40 ft high",v s m,7 segments,none,"While casting this spell, the druid designates a central point for the spell’s origin up to 360 ft from where he or she stands. When the druid utters the final words of the incantation, this focal point belches forth a massive cloud of stinging insects, which boils outward almost instantly to fill the spell’s area of effect. Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force, etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point. Even a fireball or flame strike will do nothing other than temporarily (1 turn) to clear the insects out of the area affected by their flames.",
druid,Invisibility to Animals,1,touch,1 turn + 1 round/lvl,Creature touched,s m,4 segments,none,"With a gesture, the druid or other recipient of the spell fades from the sight, sound, and smell of any animal (i.e. creature listed under “Animal” in Chapter V). Creatures with intelligence of 6+ are not affected by the spell. This powerful form of invisibility is not dispelled if the druid attacks, although a particular creature being attacked with a hand-held weapon will, of course, be aware of the druid’s general location and be entitled to attack with a –4 penalty until the druid moves out of its immediate area. Druids will, by nature of their calling, not use this spell to commit wholesale slaughter upon animals except in extraordinary circumstances.",
druid,Locate Animals,1,caster,1 round/ caster lvl,"Path 20 ft wide, 20 ft/ caster lvl long",v s m,1 round,none,"The caster becomes able to divine the presence of a particular kind of animal in the direction he or she views. The druid must concentrate for a full round in a particular direction in order to gain the insight granted by the spell. The spell’s enchantment affects the caster, so the effects move with him or her. The divination is not blocked by any intervening substance, of any thickness.",
druid,Locate Plants,2,Caster,1 turn/ caster lvl,5 ft radius/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"When this spell is used by a druid, he or she is able to locate any desired type of plant within the area of effect. Note: the plant type must be singular and concentrated upon. The spell's area of effect centres on, and moves with, the druid.",
druid,Neutralise Poison,3,touch,instantaneous,Creature touched,v s,5 segments,none (neg.),"By means of a Neutralize Poison spell, the druid detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or substance touched. Note that an opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched requires the druid to score a hit in melee combat. Effects of the spell are permanent only with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch, i.e. creatures (or objects) which generate new poison will not be permanently detoxified. The reversed spell, Poison, likewise requires an attack (a ""to hit"" touch which succeeds), and the victim is allowed a saving throw versus poison. If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is killed by the poison.",
druid,Obscurement,2,0,4 rounds/ caster lvl,10 x 10 ft cube/ caster lvl,v s,4 segments,none,"As this spell is completed, an enchanted mist billows from the area where the druid stands, rapidly filling the area of effect and reducing visibility therein to 1d4 x2 ft. The spell is affected by natural conditions such as strong winds, which will reduce the spell’s effective duration.",
druid,Pass Plant,5,touch,see text,see text,v s m,7 segments,none,"By means of this spell, the druid steps into one tree and steps out from a distant tree of the same type. The druid determines the direction in which he or she will travel from one tree to another. Most trees permit a maximum distance of travel of 300 yards, but trees sacred to druids allow travel of considerably greater distance; oak, yew, and rowan trees permit the druid to travel as far as 600 yards. If no tree of the same type is to be found in the direction the druid designates, he or she will emerge from any tree of that species within the spell’s range closest to the direction he or she specified. The druid may remain in the first tree for as long as one round per caster level before being forced to leave the other tree, and in this case he or she will be treated in the same way as for a plant door spell. If no appropriate tree is available for the druid to step from, he or she may remain in the first tree for the spell’s duration, but will not be able to use the spell for travelling.",
druid,Pass Without Trace,1,touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,1 round,none,"Any creature upon which this spell is cast can move through any sort of terrain without leaving behind the slightest sign of its passage. It leaves no footprints, no scent, and no other telltales of movement. It is impossible to trace its path except, temporarily, by one method—the path will radiate magic for 6d6 turns. Once this time elapses, the magical aura will fade away, leaving the trail undisturbed by any sign that the spell’s recipient was ever there.",
druid,Plant Door,4,touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,6 segments,none,"This spell allows the druid to travel effortlessly through vegetation of any kind, stepping through it as if it did not exist.

The pathway opened by the spell may be up to 5 ft wide, 10 ft high, and up to 120 ft/ caster level in length. The druid may even use the spell to shift inside a tree or move through an area of plants affected by a spell (such as entangle). If the druid is within a tree that is attacked, he or she must leave the tree before it is killed or die with the tree.",
druid,Plant Growth,3,160 ft,permanent,20 x 20 ft sq/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"By means of this spell, the druid causes plants and vines to grow with unbelievable speed, forming a tangled barrier of thick vegetation. The enchantment may be dispelled, or the plants cleared by normal means. Chopping a way through the barrier is possible, but movement is restricted to 10 ft/ turn (20 ft for size L creatures).",
druid,Predict Weather,1,0,instantaneous,9 square miles,v s m,1 round,none,"The druid casts this spell upon virtually any substance: bones, leaves, powders, etc. He or she can read in the resulting pattern an exact divination of the weather as it will naturally occur with-in the surrounding nine square miles for the next two hours per caster level.

It can be used to set fires and may also be thrown as a missile. The throwing range of the flame is 40 ft, and when the flame hits an object it will explode, igniting all combustible material in a radius of 15 ft.

druid,Protection From Fire,3,touch,see text,one creature,v s m,5 segments,none,"The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from fire upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon himor herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to fires of magical nature, such as dragon’s breath. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal fire and a saving throw bonus of +4 against fire based attacks. Any damage incurred by fire attacks will also reduced by half. If the spell is cast upon the druid, he or she becomes completely invulnerable to normal fire and also ignores all damage from magical fire (dragon breath, fireball, etc.) until a total of 12 hp/caster level has been absorbed by the spell, at which time the spell will be dissipated.",
druid,Protection From Lightning,4,touch,see text,one creature,v s m,6 segments,none,"This spell lends the recipient the same protection against lightning and electricity as the third level spell protection from fire affords against fire: The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from lightning upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon himor herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to lightning or electricity of a magical nature. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal lightning and a saving throw bonus of +4 against lightning based attacks.

druid,Purify Water,1,40 ft,instantaneous,1 cubic ft/ caster lvl,v s,1 round,n,"This spell removes all impurities from water, making it clear and drinkable. The reverse of the spell contaminates water, making it impossible to drink, and will negate the properties of holy and unholy water.",
druid,Pyrotechnics,3,160 ft,see text,see text,v s m,5 segments,none,"The pyrotechnics spell may be used to produce two entirely different effects: a bright display of fiery light or a massive pall of smoke. Both possible uses of the spell require an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell’s range), and the spell’s area of effect depends on the size of the originating fire. If the spell is used to produce fireworks, the flashing display will temporarily blind (for 1d4+1 rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond—provided that the display is not obstructed from view, of course. The fireworks fill an area ten times the volume of the original fire source and persist for 1 segment/ caster level. If the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft in an area 100 times the volume of the fire source.

druid,Snare,3,touch,permanent (until triggered),10 ft radius + 6 ft/ caster lvl,v s m,3 rounds,none,"This spell is used to enchant a normal snare, making it hard to detect and supernaturally effective. The spell is cast upon a rope, vine, or cord, which then blends perfectly with the surroundings, becoming 90% undetectable to normal (unenchanted) vision. When any creature steps into the area bounded by the snare, the snare will whip closed and bind the victim tightly. Strength of 23 is required to break the snare for one hour after the spell is triggered, and the strength required falls by one point per hour until 12 hours have elapsed, at which time the spell ceases to have any effect. If the snare is attached to a suitably flexible tree, the spell will magically bend the tree so that when the trap is triggered it will snap the victim into the air for 1d6 points of damage and hold it suspended from the branches.",

If the plants are capable of motion, it will be possible for the druid to persuade them into a course of action, such as drawing aside to allow passage, or even attacking an enemy citadel.",

The snakes may be ordered to take other actions if the druid can speak with them, but this spell alone does not grant the power to communicate with the snakes, only to will them to attack particular opponents. The spell transforms one stick per caster level, and each snake has a 5% chance per caster level of being venomous. The reverse of the spell will change snakes into harmless sticks and can work such a transformation upon snakes created by means of this spell.

There is a 70% chance that the swarm will be composed of flying insects, 30% chance that the insects will be ants or other non-airborne biting vermin. A flying swarm can move tremendously fast, but a crawling swarm is limited to movement of 12 ft/ round. In either case, the insects automatically inflict 2 hp damage per round against their target, and the unfortunate victim will be so thickly covered as to be incapable of any action, including movement. The druid may redirect the swarm to attack another opponent, but the command will cause 1 round of confusion within the swarm as it reorients itself toward the new target.",

Any volume of mud will sink until its depth is equal to about one half the pool’s diameter. If this spell is cast upon a ceiling, the resulting volume of mud will immediately collapse, possibly trapping or suffocating those caught beneath. Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed). The spell’s reverse transforms mud into sandstone or a similar sedimentary rock.",

Upon casting this spell, the druid may travel almost instantly from one plant to another through the mystic oneness that joins all life forms. The spell operates in much the same fashion as pass plant, but with an unlimited range. When the spell is cast, the druid simply steps into a large plant of any kind and disappears into it. He or she may remain in the first plant for up to 24 hours, but at any time he or she may step forth from another plant of the same species in another location. The druid may know of a specific plant from which he or she wants to emerge, or may simply specify a distance and a direction. If the druid does not know of a specific destination plant, his or her arrival may be off by 1d% miles from the desired point of arrival, at the GM’s discretion.",

The spell is neither an illusion nor a charm: the druid is, for all intents and purposes, a tree. However, in tree shape the druid retains human senses and will be fully aware of his or her surroundings. The druid may shift back into human shape at will, thereby ending the spell. Magical detections will reveal the druid’s true form, but ordinary inspections, no matter how minute, will not.",

The Trip spell causes the object to rise slightly off the ground or floor it is resting on and trip creatures crossing it if they fail to make their saving throw versus magic. Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the magicked object, i.e. a 3' long piece of rope could trip only 1 man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped will take 1-6 (d6) hit points of damage and be stunned for 2-5 (d4+1) rounds if the surface they full upon is very hard, but if it is turf or non-hard they will merely be stunned for 2-5 segments. Very large creatures such as elephants will not be at all affected by a Trip. The object magicked will continue to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spell caster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures aware of the object and its potential add +4 to their saving throw when crossing it. The object is 80% undetectable without magical means of detection.",

Even very large wooden structures that are not affixed to the ground will be affected, although objects fixed to the ground will manage to withstand the spell’s awesome power. A saplingsized or smaller piece of wood will splinter and break even if it is firmly affixed. The druid need not concentrate on maintaining the waves of force and cannot change the direction of the flow of eldritch power once it is set.",
druid,Wall of Fire,5,80 ft (wall) or caster (ring),see text,see text,v s m,7 segments,none,"One of the more dramatic examples of druidic magic is the wall of fire spell, by which the druid calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the shape of a wall. One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict.",
druid,Wall of Thorns,6,80 ft,1 turn/ lvl,100 ft cube/ caster lvl,v s,8 segments,none,"When the druid casts this spell, a tangled wall of briar vines erupts from the ground, bristling with sharp, deadly thorns. Running into or attempting to force a way through the thorns will cause 8 hp damage, plus 1 hp for every point of armour class. A creature may be caught within the wall of thorns when the spell is cast, and if this is the case it will take damage immediately and must fight through (taking damage a second time) to gain enough freedom of motion to chop at the thorns. It takes four turns to cut through a 40 ft thickness of a wall of thorns. Normal fire has no effect upon a wall of thorns, but magical fire can ignite the entire growth, creating a wall of fire (as per the spell) that burns away to nothing in two turns.",

Multiple items may be affected; four arrows have about the same volume as an axe handle. A fifth-level druid could effectively destroy a normal door with this spell.",

The spell does not influence the animals’ attitude toward the caster, so it is advisable to ensure ahead of time that they are friendly. The reverse of the spell halves their size and damage inflicted.",

The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good casters unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A caster may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level.",
magic_user,Anti-Magic Shell,6,caster,1 turn/ lvl,5 ft radius (+per level) globe,v s,1 segment,none,"An anti-magic shell is a bubble of space around the magic user that completely prevents all magic from operating within its confines. Spell effects do not enter or function within the shell, providing the caster with complete protection from gaze attacks, hostile spells, and even the entrance of conjured or summoned creatures into his or her vicinity. The drawback of an anti-magic shell, of course, is that the caster him- or herself cannot cast spells or avail him- or herself of magic items while inside. Magic weapons, armour, and the like do not gain their bonuses or abilities while inside the shell, but would still function as non-magical weapons or armour.",

Either a race of creature or an alignment must be specified. Note that if the spell is cast upon an object rather than an area, the targeted type of creature will have a penalty of –2 on the saving throw. If the caster creates an antipathy for the area or object, the targeted creature type will feel an intense desire to stay away from it. A saving throw applies, permitting the creature to remain, or to touch the object, but even if the saving throw is successful the creature will feel extremely uncomfortable in its presence. Creatures that are able to remain in the area or near the object will begin to lose 1 point of dexterity per round (maximum 4 points) from discomfort. If the caster creates sympathy for an object or area, on the other hand, the targeted creature type will feel attracted to the area or object, pleased to remain in the vicinity, or covetous of the “precious” item. If the creature does not make a saving throw, it will do whatever is in its power to stay in contact with the area or the enchanted object.",
magic_user,Astral Spell,9,touch,see text,see text,v s,9 segments,none,"Casting an astral spell allows the caster and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the caster may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form. Most magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.",

The caster designates a focal point for the spell, which must, of course, be within the spell’s range. The focal point can be moved by the caster at will until the spell’s duration expires. The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster’s level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds. Players must state such disbelief, while the GM will make such determinations for monsters and NPCs based on the plausibility of the audible glamour.",
magic_user,Blink,3,caster,1 round/ lvl,caster,v s,1 segment,none,"This spell is a weak and rather unreliable form of one of the true mage’s most powerful capabilities: teleportation magic. For the duration of the spell, the magic user teleports 2 ft in a random direction once per round. The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10 ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence. During and after the segment in which the teleportation occurs, the magic user’s sudden change of location prevents any direct attacks upon him or her. The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area of effect spell, he will suffer its effects. The constant changes of location take a toll upon the caster, who has a 25% chance of failing at attempts to cast spells, use most magic items, or take any action beyond making physical attacks.",

In order to cast the spell, the caster must know the fiend’s true name, but such information is often contained in forbidden tomes of lost lore. The spell cannot summon the lesser sorts of demons that have no personal names, nor is it powerful enough to summon members of the demonic or diabolical nobility. The spell provides no protection whatsoever against the wrath of the summoned creature—and make no mistake, the summoned creature will be extremely resentful of the caster’s temerity. In general, this spell is cast only with multiple protections against the summoned fiend, such as a pentacle to contain the demon and a magic circle to protect the magic user. The exact nature of any discussions or negotiations with creatures of the nether planes is, of course, a matter to be handled in the course of the game, with the GM deciding what the fiend is thinking and how it acts. It is treacherous in the extreme to deal with demons, for they are intelligent and ruthless. They are not, however, unreliable; since the caster knows the fiend’s true name, it is compelled to abide by any agreements it might make, although it might be able to twist the spirit of the agreement while still abiding to the letter of it. Certain spells (spirit-rack or trap the soul, for example) can be (and often are) used to strengthen the magic user’s hand in any negotiations with a demon.",

The base number of creatures is 2d8, but additional creatures may be affected; if the caster’s caster level is higher than the HD of the strongest opponent, the difference is the number of additional creatures that must make saving throws. This spell is extremely powerful; all saving throws are made with a penalty of -2. Creatures that fail their saving throws (check each round) act randomly in accordance with the following table.

The particular form of elemental to be summoned is a part of the spell’s incantation, so the magic user must memorise the spell for a particular element. The magic user exerts control over the elemental by concentrating upon it, and if his or her concentration is broken by being damaged or grabbed, he or she will lose control of the elemental. The magic user’s ability to control the elemental is limited to 30 ft. There is a 1 in 20 chance per round after the second round that the elemental will break free of the magic user’s control even if the magic user is concentrating upon maintaining it. If the elemental breaks free of the magic user’s control or if the magic user ceases to concentrate upon it, it will seek to attack the magic user as soon as it can finish any combat in which it is involved. A magic user can, of course, avail him- or herself of protections against an elemental such as the use of a magic circle or a protection from evil spell.

The caster decides how deeply he or she wishes to probe into the realities beyond the material (unless he or she chooses to contact an elemental plane for information about that plane). The difficulty of the mental task is measured in terms of how many fundamental contradictions of reality the caster can assimilate and simultaneously juggle in his or her mind. The price of failure is insanity. Contacting an elemental plane provides a 90% chance that the being contacted will have the knowledge the magic user seeks, if the magic user is asking about the particular elemental plane. There is a 25% chance that the being will tell a lie, or that the information will be couched in such inherently contradictory language that it cannot be understood. If the magic user seeks information about the material plane or non-elemental planes, he or she must delve into the fundamental contradictions of extra-planar metaphysics, described on the following table.  If the caster is driven insane by what he or she finds or by simple cognitive breakdown, the insanity will last 1-10 weeks, and there is a 1% chance that the caster will die or commit suicide at the end of this period if it is not removed (by a remove curse spell, wish, etc.).

Creatures at the edge of the pit have some likelihood of falling in; they must roll lower than their dexterity score on a d20 to avoid sliding into the sudden maelstrom of moving earth. A creature moving toward the pit during the first round in which digging begins must make a saving throw vs spells (unlisted categories) or fall into the hole.

Before the spell can actually be cast, the magic user must engage in considerable time-consuming and meticulous work, or the spell will certainly fail. Firstly, the item itself must be of absolutely the finest quality available, in terms of craftsmanship, although it need not necessarily be fancy. In most cases, special components such as powders or threads will be incorporated into the item’s construction, costing not less than 100 gp. The casting of the spell takes 1d8+2 days, with the caster working steadily upon the item for eight hours per day. No other spells may be cast during this period of time, nor can the magic user engage in any other meaningful work. When the final words of the spell are spoken, the item makes a saving throw against spells at the same level as the magic user, but with success on the saving throw indicating that the spell has succeeded. A natural result of 1 on this roll always indicates failure of the spell. At this point, the magic user may begin to infuse the item with enchantments, each of which requires 5d8 hours to complete. Most magic items will require unusual components; dragon scales or blood for a sword with an unusually high bonus against dragons, for example. The GM will determine exactly what is required for any particular magic item. This spell is not permanent unless a permanency spell is cast upon it; the duration of the enchantment may be for a year or more without a permanency spell, but the enchantment will eventually fail if it is not locked in to the item.

The magic user’s power limits the volume of material that he or she can enlarge; the mage can affect no more than 10 cubic ft of living matter, or 5 cubic ft of non-living matter, per level. A normal sized person doubled in size will generally have strength of 18, and tripled in size would have strength of 20+. The spell’s reverse applies in the same ratios, but with the effect of reducing the size of an object or creature.

Furthermore, if a thief attempts to remove the illusory trap, believing it to be real, there is only a 20% likelihood that the illusion will be dispelled or exposed by these efforts. In this case, the thief, seeing the illusion unchanged, will usually conclude that the attempt to remove the “trap” has failed.

magic_user,Find Familiar,1,0,see text,1 mile radius/ caster lvl,v s m,2d12 hours,see text,"Magic users of higher level often summon familiars to assist them with various tasks. Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others’ estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a well-stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary (2d12 hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond. When it arrives, the familiar is a faithful servant and ally to the caster. Normal familiars have 1d3+1 hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lowerthan-average human. When the familiar is within 120 ft of the magic user, the magic user gains additional hit points equal to the familiar’s. However, if the familiar is ever killed, the magic user permanently loses twice the familiar’s hit points (See table).  A special familiar is entitled to a saving throw in order to avoid the effect of the spell. The type of special familiar to appear depends upon the magic user’s alignment (See table).

If the magic user fails a saving throw against a cold based attack, however, he or she will suffer twice the normal damage. Hot flame offers the converse of the protections afforded by cold flame.

A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion. Detecting a fire trap is extraordinarily difficult; attempts to find traps are reduced by one-half in efficacy if the trap is a fire trap, and the trap will detonate if an attempt to remove traps fails.

Creatures making successful saving throws suffer only half the indicated damage. When the magic user casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its path the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire volume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area smaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area until the spell’s full volume has been reached. The volume of a 20 ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic ft, and there are 1,000 cubic ft in a 10 × 10 × 10 ft area, so in an area with a 10 ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10 × 10 ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell. The flames do not create any significant change in air pressure, but the furnace-like heat causes all items in the blast to make saving throws against magical fire or ignite (or, in the case of metals, melt).

The enchanted arrows have no bonus to hit, and the enchantment is not powerful enough to hit a creature that can be damaged only by magical weapons. Each arrow causes 1 hp of fire damage in addition to its normal damage. The arrows (or crossbow bolts) will burn up in one round, so they must be shot before this time. ",

Regrettably, the effect is temporary, but an amoral caster might seek to shift the consequent feelings of regret onto another person than him- or herself. Whatever motives drive the caster, he or she may use this spell to transmute roughly 2,000 copper coins (about a cubic foot) per caster level into a metal that closely resembles gold. Anyone viewing this metal has a chance to notice that it is not truly gold. If the result of d20 plus the caster’s level is equal to or less than the observer’s intelligence, the fraud is detected (the GM may pick a representative number for creatures whose exact intelligence is not known, or roll a die). By combining expensive material components with the spell, the caster can make it more likely that the gold will seem true—conversely, there are mundane methods that give a chance to detect this very spell, such as striking the “gold” with cold iron (10% chance of changing the metal back). The GM will decide for his or her campaign exactly what can be done to improve and detect this spell. ",

Unlike the interposing hand, the forceful hand can push opponents or objects. The hand can move a creature weighing 500 lbs or less. It reduces the speed of a creature between 500 and 2,000 lbs to no greater than 10 ft / round, and it slows the movement of creatures heavier than 2,000 lbs but smaller than 8,000 lbs to one-half.

The spell obliterates memory of the last round plus one additional round per three caster levels. The caster decides which creatures in the spell’s area to affect, and these must make saving throws or suffer the loss of memory. The caster may designate 1-4 creatures as the targets of the spell. If one is targeted, the saving throw is made with a –2 penalty; if two are targeted, the penalty is –1; and if 3 or 4 creatures are targeted they suffer no penalty to the saving throw.

Ice seed|Conjures a sphere of an intensely cold magical substance that freezes water to a depth of 6 inches over a surface area 100 square ft/ caster level. The ice is thick enough to walk upon without fear of falling through. The duration of the ice is 1 round/ level. The material component for this use is a piece of crystal.
Ice ray|A ray of cold lances from the caster’s hand, inflicting 4 hp/ caster level against anything in its path. A successful saving throw results in no damage. Even if the ray strikes an object, it continues on the other side until it has extended 10 ft/ caster level or is stopped by a thickness of stone of 1 ft or more. The material component for this use is a gem worth 1,000 gp.
Shattering globe|The spell forms a globe one inch in diameter, cold but not uncomfortable to the touch. When this sphere is thrown (by hand or sling), it will explode upon impact for 4d6 hit points of damage within a 10 ft radius (half if save vs spells). If not used within 1 round/ caster level, it will explode at the time its duration ends. The material component for this use is also a gem worth 1,000 gp.

For these creatures, the magic user’s charisma will effectively be increased by 2d4 (one roll for all). For those who succeed in making the saving throw, the caster’s charisma will effectively be lowered by 1d4. Unless the exact numbers are required for some purpose, the normal result of the spell will be that those who failed the saving throw will be well-disposed and friendly toward the caster, and those that succeeded in making the save will find him or her distasteful and somewhat suspect.

Attempting to run will result in an immediate fall to a prone position, and anything held in hand (or claw, etc.) will be dropped.

magic_user,Gate,9,30 ft,see text,One summoned creature,v s,9 segments,none,"A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and Irascible.",
magic_user,Geas,6,touch,see text,one creature,v s,4 segments,none,"A geas is a magical compulsion placed upon an intelligent creature to perform, or refrain from performing, some task set by the caster. While the geas cannot compel suicide or its equivalent, it is a very powerful spell. If the creature under the geas avoids or is prevented from performing the task, it will sicken and die within 1d4 weeks if the task is not resumed. The disease will, of course, create symptoms that the GM will determine; if the geas is resumed, these may or may not remain until the task is completed. Even a remove curse spell will not remove a geas, although a wish spell is powerful enough to dispel it. ",

The magic user can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; he or she must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates magical effects within the warded area (see tables).  The whole warded area radiates strong magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

Fog|Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including infravision, beyond 10 ft.
Wizard Locks|All doors in the warded area are wizard locked.
Webs|Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical to those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts.
Confusion|Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment/ charm effect that will not affect elves or other creatures immune to charm.
Lost Doors|One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall. In addition, the magic user can place his or her choice of one of the following five magical effects:\n\n1. Dancing lights in four corridors.\n2. A magic mouth in two places.\n3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapours return within 10 turns if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts.\n4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room.\n5.

If a magic item or spell operates partially to negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. Creatures held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage. ",
magic_user,Hold Person,3,120 ft,2 rounds/ level,see text,v,3 segments,negates,"This spell has the same effect as the clerical spell hold person: to immobilise foes and render them helpless. However, the magic user’s version of the spell is somewhat more flexible in terms of the caster’s options. A hold person spell completely immobilises up to four man-sized or smaller persons for the spell’s duration. The magic user decides how many of his or her foes he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –3, if two, each makes the saving throw at –1, and if the magic user seeks to hold three or four enemies, each makes his or her saving throw with no penalty. Creatures affected by this spell would include humans, demi-humans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. If a magic item or spell operates to partially negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target.

The portal must be something that normally opens and closes, such as a door, gate, valve, or portcullis, and it must be closed for the spell to function. A magically held portal can be battered apart, but will not open normally until the spell’s duration expires. This is not a particularly powerful spell; any being not native to the material planes (such as a demon) will ignore its effects, as will a magic user four or more levels higher than the caster.

The hailstorm is a vicious barrage of huge hailstones that pound into a 40 ft × 40 ft area, throwing up bits of shrapnel-like ice fragments as the hail shatters. Any creature within the area suffers 3d10 hit points of damage with no saving throw. The sleet storm is a maelstrom of frozen rain in an 80 ft × 80 ft area, blinding all creatures in the area of effect and making the footing so slippery that all movement is cut by 50%.

Insights include magical effects (and the corresponding command word) and number of charges (plus or minus 25% of the actual number). The exact bonus (or penalty) of a weapon is not revealed to the player, unless the GM chooses to do so for convenience; the character, of course, would not think of a magic sword as being “+1” or “+3,” just as “enchanted” or “powerfully enchanted,” and the spell reveals information in these terms. The spell must be cast within 1 hour/ caster level of the time a magic item first comes near the caster, or the magic user’s own aura will have blended too much into the item’s aura, contaminating his ability to read it. Upon casting the spell, the magic user temporarily loses 8 points of constitution, and regains them by resting for one hour per recovered point.

The only way to free an imprisoned creature is with the reverse of the spell, and the caster must know the name of the prisoner together with enough detail to clearly identify him or her. A creature freed from imprisonment appears at the exact spot where the imprisonment took place. When casting the spell’s reverse, if the caster is not specific enough about the imprisoned creature’s identity the spell will normally fail; but there is also a chance it will free the intended creature together with several other imprisoned victims from other places in the ground—some far, some (perhaps) near. Some of these freed victims might be from ancient ages and may have been imprisoned for a very good reason.

A saving throw for half damage is permitted to every creature in the cloud for each round of exposure to the flames. In the first round of the flare, the blazing cloud inflicts one hit point of damage for every two levels of the caster. In the second round of the flare, the heat increases to inflict 1 hit point per caster level, and in the third round of the blaze, damage falls again to one point per two levels. After three rounds, the cloud burns out, and for any further duration it retains only the properties of pyrotechnic smoke. ",

The item is then touched with another item, the spell’s focus, which must be of at least 5,000 gp in value (usually a gem). When the caster seeks to summon the item by means of this spell, he must hold the focus item in his hand and speak the final word of the spell. The focus item will disappear and the summoned item will appear in its place. The summoned item cannot be heavier than 8 lbs or the spell will not function. Moreover, if the item is in the possession (not necessarily in the hand) of another creature, the spell will fail.

The magic user can cause the hand to be as small as his or her own, or as large as a shield. The caster selects a foe, and the hand will place itself between the magic user and that particular enemy, moving so rapidly that it cannot be avoided. It is strong enough to hold back any creature weighing 200 lbs or less and will slow heavier opponents to half movement.

The spell’s power is far greater if the item is actually at hand when the spell is cast, for it can then be used as a focus for the gathering of echoes; casting time under these circumstances will be 1d4 turns. If the item (or place) is not at hand, but some detailed information can be woven into the casting of the spell as a focus for the gathering of legend-echoes, the casting time will be 1d10 days. If all that the caster knows about the object or place is rumour, the casting time will be 2d6 weeks. While casting the spell, the caster may not engage in any other activity other than short breaks to eat and sleep. When completed, the spell will reveal the location of any legendary material about the object (or person, or place), and if the spell is cast in the presence of the place, person, or object the spell will invariably gather the legendary lore together into a piece of true information about it. This information, coming as it does from mystical echoes, will take the form of a riddle, rhyme, or other puzzle. In order to cast the spell an item of some value—often a potion—must be used and destroyed in the process.

The bolt extends in a straight line from the caster beginning, at whatever point along the spell’s range the caster desires, and may extend beyond the spell’s range. The bolt deals 1d6 damage per caster level to all creatures standing in the bolt’s area of effect. Creatures that make successful saving throws suffer half damage. The area of effect may be either a branching, forking maelstrom of electricity 10 ft wide and 40 ft long, or it may be a concentrated blast 5 ft wide and 80 ft long. The length of the bolt itself is not affected by the caster’s level, only the range at which the caster may cause the bolt to originate. All items hit by the full force of the bolt must make item saving throws or be destroyed. The force of the bolt is often sufficient to blast doors into smouldering ruin. If the bolt strikes an object that does not conduct electricity, such as a stone wall, it will be deflected backward toward the caster (potentially inflicting a second shock upon those in the target area). Note that the length of a deflected bolt is not increased; the bolt will only rebound for the distance remaining in its original area of effect. ",
magic_user,Limited Wish,7,unlimited,instantaneous,see text,v,See text,see text,"Limited wish is a powerful spell, allowing the caster to reshape reality in accordance with his or her desire, but only to a limited degree. The spell may be used to grant minor wishes (undoing curses, granting small quantities of gold, duplicating the effects of lower level spells, etc.) The effects of the spell will be permanent for most minor requests, particularly when used to duplicate a lower-level spell that has a permanent or instantaneous duration. However, a limited wish is not powerful enough to make major changes in reality. It cannot bring the dead back to life, grant a level, or permanently change ability scores. In many cases, the GM will be called upon to determine whether the caster’s wish is within the power of a limited wish spell or whether the results of the request will suffer from flaws due to the spell’s limitations. Flaws would include limited durations or partial results. The guidelines set forth above should give the GM some assistance in making such determinations. In the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails. The guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters.

The spell is directional, requiring the caster to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The caster may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.) The reverse of the spell may be used to obscure one object from magical detection of virtually all kinds (including such means as a crystal ball as well as divination spells).",
magic_user,Lower Water,6,80 ft,5 rounds/ level,5 x 5 ft square area/ level,v s m,1 turn,none,"With a majestic gesture, the caster forces an area of water to sink downward by 5% of its original depth per caster level. Despite its name, the spell’s power is not limited to water; it can affect other non-living fl uid substances as well, including gases and materials slightly more viscous than water. The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the caster. For example, a caster of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 x 70 ft. The reverse of the spell raises water in an area of effect similar to that of lower water , but not to the same degree of height, returning water to its natural level plus one foot per caster level.",
magic_user,Mage’s Faithful Hound,5,10 ft,2 rounds/ level,see text,v s m,5 segments,none,"This spell summons an invisible watchdog to guard an area. The hound is invisible to all but the caster, who may order it to keep watch over a particular area. The area must be close to the caster, however, for if the caster is more than 30 ft from the area the hound guards, it will return to the spirit realm. The hound can detect virtually any creature that enters the area: it can detect invisibility (which includes creatures on the astral and æthereal planes), can see creatures that are moving between dimensions, and can detect virtually any other method that might be employed to sneak into an area. If any creature larger than a cat or small dog enters the area, the hound will begin baying with its echoing, supernatural bark. Moreover, it will seek to attack intruders from behind (it does not make frontal assaults) and can attack as a monster of 10 HD for 3d6 damage, even if the opponent requires up to a +3 magical weapon to be hit. The hound cannot be harmed by any means other than by dispelling it. ",
magic_user,Mage’s Sword,7,30 ft,1 round/ level,summoned sword,v s m,7 segments,none,"The caster evokes a magical sword into being and can wield it by exerting his or her will. While doing so, he or she cannot cast spells, use magic items, or move, although the spell does not end if the magic user’s concentration is broken; the sword simply does not attack during that round. The sword attacks as a fighter one-half the magic user’s caster level (and always hits on a natural 19 or 20), and it can hit creatures that can ordinarily be hit only with magic weapons. The damage caused by the sword is considerable; it inflicts 5d4 hp against size S and M creatures, or 5d6 against larger creatures. The sword can be dispelled by dispel magic. The material components for the spell cost 500 gp or more. ",

A detect magic spell will incorrectly perceive the item as magical, but if it is actually handled by the caster of the detect magic spell, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to realize that the aura is, in fact, not a true magical aura but a counterfeit. ",
magic_user,Magic Jar,5,10 ft/ level,see text,One creature,v s m,1 round,negates,"This risky spell allows the caster to transfer his or her mind into that of another creature, trapping the other creature’s soul in a gem (of not less than 100 gp value) that is the material component of the spell and becomes the magic jar. To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the targeted creature makes a successful saving throw), the caster’s soul is trapped until it can take over a host or otherwise escape. The caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but no more than one per round. The spell’s range applies to two matters; when the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the jar, his or her body must be within the spell’s range of the jar. The range also limits the distance at which the magic user’s soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster’s soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless. The spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character’s mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user’s mental power is higher. If a creature’s soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster’s soul is returned to the magic jar. If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster’s favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster’s favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster’s mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw can only be made once per week. While the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature’s mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while possessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from within the new body.

The missiles inflict 1d4+1 points of damage each. For every two caster levels beyond first, the caster gains an additional missile; thus, a first-level magic user can cast one missile, a third-level caster may cast 2, a fifth-level caster may cast 3, and so on.

The length of the message cannot exceed 25 words. The magic user can set any condition for the appearance of the magic mouth, but the caster’s power limits the range at which the mouth can detect the triggering events. The mouth can “perceive” events at a range of 5 ft/ caster level, but cannot detect invisible creatures. It has no perceptions other than visual, although it does not actually see. Obviously, a player cannot try to phrase conditions using game terms such as “hit dice,” “class,” “level,” etc. but must use terms that would be familiar to the character. ",

The combination of these two magical phenomena makes it impossible to distinguish the images from the caster without aid of a magical nature, such as true seeing. When an opponent makes a successful hit against one of the images, the image breaks up and disappears (the others remain). If an opponent attempts to attack a magic user obscured by this spell, it is randomly determined whether the to-hit roll is directed toward the person or one of the images.

For every turn spent casting, the magic user can move a cube of earth 40x40x40 ft. The spell is normally used to create walls, moats, etc., but can also be used to move an intact terrain feature from one place to another (although the spell cannot move rock unless the rock is carried within the moved earth). If an intact feature (such as a portion of a forest or the foundations under a cottage) is to be moved, an earth elemental must also be summoned.

The caster must maintain his or her concentration upon the illusion, or it will evaporate, but while concentrating the caster is able to make the illusion move and respond to events. The illusion is dispelled if it is struck with a blow, a falling person, etc. There is no saving throw against the illusion if the observer believes it, and the illusion can actually cause damage to such a deceived victim. A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real. If the observer doubts the reality of the illusion, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to see the illusion for what it really is. If one observer disbelieves the illusion and this disbelief is communicated to others, the others will also gain a saving throw at a bonus of +4. Note that the spell relies purely on a visual effect; it will have no effect upon a creature that does not see it. Furthermore, the lack of any audible component can make certain illusions completely non-credible. An explosion, for example, is not likely to be believed by anyone if it creates no sound. Various methods may be used by the GM to determine if an NPC or monster believes the effect of a phantasmal force, common sense being the first thing to consider.

Such a transformation can, in rare cases, be fatal. If the spell’s target is successfully transformed, it must make a system shock test against its constitution or die (see, “constitution”). Moreover, there is a base 100% likelihood that the transformed creature will lose its memories and former identity in the change, becoming, for all intents and purposes, the creature into which it was transformed (intelligence cannot be increased by virtue of such a transformation, however). For every intelligence point of the transformed creature, the base chance is reduced by 5%, and there is a further +/-5% alteration for each level (or HD) by which the original form’s level (or HD) differs from that of the new form. This check is made on a daily basis, so such a transformation will, eventually, become inevitable according to the laws of chance if the transformed creature is not magically brought back to its original form.

Dispel magic cannot dispel the sphere or anything beyond it (unless the first six colours have already been brought down). Magic resistance is effective against a prismatic sphere, but the check must be repeated for each colour present. Each colour in the sphere has a different effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colours, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack the caster or pass through the sphere, and the magic needed to negate each colour.

The image must remain visible to the caster or the spell will end. Much like a mirror image, the projected image mimics all the caster’s movements, but it is not affected by attacks of any kind. The image possesses an arcane link to the caster; if desired, the magic user can cast spells that originate at the image rather than at the caster, as if the image, rather than the magic user, cast the spell. Thus, the effective range of an attack spell can be increased, or a spell that would ordinarily centre on the caster could be brought into effect around the projected image. ",

The aura is not invulnerable, but it affords considerable protection against evil and summoned creatures, much as a powerful magic circle would. The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extra-planar creatures regardless of alignment. To cast either form of the spell, the caster speaks the ritual words of the spell while describing a circle around the being to be warded, using holy water or incense (blood or smouldering dung for the reverse of the spell).",

The supernatural force exerted by the spell is only about one lb per level of the caster, but the spell can be used to move small objects or to throw enemies off balance. A small object can be moved at a rate of 10 ft/ round (directly away from the caster), and if the object is a weapon held by a creature, the creature will suffer a penalty to hit equal to the caster’s level. For example, a tenth level magic user could exert so much eldritch force against an attacking orc’s axe that the orc would suffer a –10 to hit with it. Moving an actual creature or a heavier object is only possible if the creature’s weight in lbs is not more than 50 times the caster’s level. ",

Both possible uses of the spell require an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell’s range), and the spell’s area of effect depends on the size of the originating fire. If the spell is used to produce fireworks, the flashing display will temporarily blind (for 1d4+1 rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond—provided that the display is not obstructed from view, of course. The fireworks fill an area ten times the volume of the original fire source and persist for 1 segment/ caster level. If the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft in an area 100 times the volume of the fire source.

No attack roll is required to hit. If the target fails a sav ing throw, its strength and the effect of all attacks which are dependent upon strength are reduced by 25%. The amount of reduction is increased by 1%/ caster level (to be rounded off in the case of lower-level magic users simply as a matter of convenience). Thus, if an orc is struck with the ray by a level one magic user, the orc would lose 26% (rounded to 25%, at the option of the GM) of its strength. Its to-hit rolls are not affected, but any damage it inflicts is reduced to 75% (or 74%) of the damage rolled (a good GM avoids minuscule calculations that might bog down the game). A ray of enfeeblement may technically reduce the target’s strength below the required minimum to qualify for a class, but its effects are too temporary to affect class choices (so an enfeebled paladin with a temporary strength of 8 retains his or her paladinhood).

Unless the writings are cursed, reading magical script does not normally activate the magic formulae described therein—reviewing a scroll prior to casting from it does not, for instance, actually cast whatever spell is written upon the scroll. Once the magic user has read a particular set of magical inscriptions by use of this spell, the spell is no longer needed to re-read the writing at a later time. The reverse of the spell allows the magic user to make magical writings indecipherable for the spell’s duration, and is cast upon the writing rather than upon the caster him- or herself. ",

The chest itself must be crafted of the finest materials in order to support the spell’s magic, and it will cost a mini mum of 5,000 gp to have a craftsman or craftsmen build it, together with a second, miniature copy. When the magic user casts the spell, one hand upon the chest and one upon the miniature, the chest disappears into the æthereal plane, together with its contents.

To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature’s name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires 8d6 hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend’s presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created. When the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend’s presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend’s magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining pos session of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain. In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster’s level. Obviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend’s goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.

The magic user must be familiar with the destination (see table), but there is no effective range to the spell, although it does not permit travel to other planes.

To see how well the teleportation works, the player will roll d% and consult the preceding table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms contained in table:

Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied care fully” is a place the caster knows well, either because he

or she can currently see it, has been there often, or has used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist, or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such, or has been so completely altered as to no longer be considered “familiar.”

When travelling to a false destination, the player rolls 1d20+80 on the table rather than rolling d%, as there is no real destination.

On Target: The caster appears in the correct location.

Off Target: The caster appears safely, a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The direction off target is determined randomly

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that is visually or thematically (depending on how the caster identified it while casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance) that this result will indicate that the correct location has been reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, falling 1d% ft unless there is means to arrest the fall. If the party arrives too high and the result would entomb them in a solid surface, they die instantly. Generally, the caster will appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with him or her arrive beneath the destination point, causing instant death if the area is solid. ","$Teleport Table:Familiarity|On Target|Off Target|Similar Area|Mishap

The victim does not age or change in any way and does not need to breathe or eat. The sleep lasts until the victim is awakened by the use of dispel magic or the spell’s reverse form. ,
magic_user,Time Stop,9,10 ft,1 segment/ 2 levels + 1d8 segments,15 ft radius sphere,v,9 segments,none,"This spell allows the caster to act between two moments of time, in a bubble where the outside is frozen in place, not moving in the flow of time’s passage. The spell’s common name is a misnomer, for time does not actually stop; rather the caster simply gains a few “extra” moments, captured in between the points of time’s normal passage. Effectively, the caster simply gains the duration of the spell as extra time in which he or she may perform whatever actions he or she wishes, while the rest of the universe is effectively frozen relative to the caster. ",
magic_user,Tiny Hut,3,0,6 turns/ level,5 ft radius sphere,v s m,3 segments,none,"This spell causes a bubble of magical force to form around the caster. The field will extend through solid substances if necessary, providing a complete sphere of protection even against burrowing creatures. When the caster stands on the ground, the sphere will thus appear to be a hemisphere, with half of it beneath the ground. The field’s outside sur face is not transparent and is usually a dark amber colour, but anyone inside the sphere can see through to the out side as if the force field did not exist. The spell provides pro tection against inclement winds and temperature within a certain range, but offers no protection against attacks from outside. Anyone can pass into and out of the hut, and up to 6 medium-sized or 8 small creatures can shelter inside with the caster. If the caster leaves the hut, the spell ends. Inside the hut, the inhabitants will not feel winds of up to 50 mph, which are completely blocked by the bubble of force, but if the wind reaches gale force of 50 mph the tiny hut will be shredded into oblivion. The temperature inside the hut remains at a pleasant 70 ̊ Fahrenheit for so long as the outside temperature remains in a range from 0 ̊ to 100 ̊. For every degree of outside temperature beyond this range, the temperature inside the hut will rise or fall accordingly from 70 ̊. The caster may illuminate the inside of the hut with a dim, ambient light that will not, of course, show to the outside. ",
magic_user,Tongues,3,0,1 round/ level,30 ft radius,v m,3 segments,none,"Within the radius established by this spell, the caster, and the caster alone, will be able to speak and understand any verbal language, including alignment tongues. Note that the spell’s area of effect does not move with the caster. The reverse of the spell makes any verbal communica tion impossible for any person (not just the caster) in the spell’s area, or may be used to cancel out the effects of the tongues spell. ",
magic_user,Transformation,6,caster,1 round/ level,caster,v s m,6 segments,none,"Upon the completion of this spell, the caster’s form and mind alter as he or she takes on the spirit and attributes of a powerful berserker warrior. The caster’s existing hit points are doubled, and any damage sustained is first deducted from the “additional” hit points with no deduction from the “true” hit points until the additional hit points are gone. Once the additional hit points are gone, however, the caster sustains twice normal damage from attacks. The caster’s armour class improves by four points, and he or she attacks as a fighter of the same level. The transformed magic user may only use a dagger as a weapon while in this berserk state, but may attack twice per round, inflicting a +2 bonus on all damage. The magic user cannot cancel the effects of this spell, and will continue to attack until all enemies are killed or the spell duration ends. In order to cast this spell, the magic user must consume a potion of heroism. ",
magic_user,Transmute Rock to Mud,5,10 ft/ level,see text,20 ft cube/ level,v s m,5 segments,none,"This spell transforms solid rock into mud, the volume transformed being proportionate to the caster’s level. Any volume of mud will sink until its depth is equal to about one half the pool’s diameter. If this spell is cast upon a ceiling, the resulting volume of mud will immediately collapse, possibly trapping or suffocating those caught beneath. Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed). The spell’s reverse transforms mud into sandstone or a similar sedimentary rock.",
magic_user,Trap the Soul,8,10 ft,permanent,One creature,v s m,See text,see text,"This spell traps a victim’s soul within a gem for eternity unless the prisoner is rescued. The prison must be pre pared ahead of time, by the use of various spells and rituals costing 1,000 gp per level or hit die of the creature to be trapped. The trap may be sprung by either of two meth ods: either speaking the final word of the spell (which re quires one segment and grants the target a saving throw) or persuading the victim to accept a pre-prepared trigger item (in which case no saving throw is permitted—the imprisonment is automatic). When a being is freed from imprisonment, even player characters, the being that has performed the rescue may demand a service or task from the freed prisoner. For unknown reasons, the request af fects the prisoner in the same manner as a geas.",
magic_user,Unseen Servant,1,caster,6 turns + 1 turn/ lvl,30 ft radius around spell caster,v s m,1 segment,none,"By means of this spell, the caster summons a mindless magi cal force to perform simple tasks. The servant can fetch and carry things, open doors, hold chairs, clean, mend, etc. It will continue at its assigned task until it is given another command. An unseen servant cannot exert force of more than twenty lbs. Unseen servants can neither attack nor move beyond the spell’s area of effect. ",
magic_user,Vanish,7,touch,instantaneous or permanent—see text,One object,v,2 segments,none,"The caster’s magic words cause an object to vanish, either being teleported away or shifted into the æthereal plane and replaced with stone on the material plane. The caster can teleport an object that weighs no more than 50 lbs per caster level to a location of his or her choice (subject to the normal rules of a teleport spell). If the object is larger, or if the caster chooses not to change its location, he may instead shift the object into the æthereal plane, to be re placed with shapeless stone. A dispel magic cast upon such stone will return the object to the material plane. Items that are part of larger structures, such as doors or windows, may be caused to vanish.",
magic_user,Ventriloquism,1,10 ft/ level (max 60 ft),2 rounds + 1 round/ level,One object,v m,1 segment,see text,"The caster makes his or her voice (or any sound he or she can vocalize) seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. For each point of intelligence of the listener over 12, there is a cumulative 10% chance to correctly per ceive the source of the sound. ",
magic_user,Wall of Fire,4,60 ft,see text,see text,v s m,4 segments,none,"One of the more dramatic examples of cast magic is the wall of fire spell, by which the caster calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the shape of a wall. One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 2d6 damage plus 1 hp/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict. If the wall is configured as a ring its radius will be 10 ft + 3 ft/ level.",
magic_user,Wall of Force,5,30 ft,1 turn + 1 turn/ level,20 ft square/ level,v s m,5 segments,none,"A wall of force is a barrier of magical power, invisible but vir- tually impervious to all attacks, blocking almost anything from passing through it. The wall is utterly unaffected by physical attacks and spells, including dispel magic, and all forms of energy, such as electricity, heat, and cold. The only way actually to destroy a wall of force is with a disintegrate spell. The wall remains in place even if the ground beneath it is destroyed or transformed, hanging magically in place where it was evoked. ",
magic_user,Wall of Ice,4,10 ft/ level,1 turn/ level,"Wall, area 100 sq ft/ level, 10 ft",v s m,4 segments,none,"A wall of ice spell creates a huge wall of ice, with a front face of up to 100 square ft per level. Its exact dimensions are adjustable by the caster. Thus, if the wall is cast by a 20th level caster, the dimensions of the wall could be any combination of dimensions that multiply to equal 2,000 square ft. The wall might be 10 ft high and 200 ft long, or 5 ft high and 400 ft long, or 20 ft high and 100 ft long, etc. The wall need not be cast so that it is attached to anything, and it can even be cast in the air to fall upon opponents, doing 3d10 points of damage in the area where it falls. Breaking through the ice with a melee weapon causes 2 hit points of damage from ice shards per inch of thickness, and can be broken out at a rate of 10 ft per round. Normal fire has no measurable effect upon the wall, but magical fire will melt through it in one round. If the wall is destroyed by fire in a single round, it will cause a massive cloud of water vapour to form and linger for a full turn, obscuring vision by 50%. ",
magic_user,Wall of Iron,5,5 ft/ level,permanent,15 x 15 ft square/ level,v s m,5 segments,none,"By casting wall of iron, the magic user creates a sheet of solid iron, one quarter of an inch thick per caster level, with dimensions of 15 sq. ft/ caster level. The configuration of the square footage is determined by the caster, but must be rectangular. The wall must be vertical if it is created upon the ground, but may be created horizontally in the air, falling to crush whatever is beneath. The wall is natural iron and can be affected by rust or transmutations, but its existence is magical and may be dispelled. ",
magic_user,Wall of Stone,5,5 ft/ level,permanent,20 x 20 ft sq/ level,v s m,5 segments,none,"When the spell is completed, a wall of stone is called into being, sprouting from existing stone formations. In order for the spell to succeed, there must be existing rock large enough to serve as the anchor on each side of the wall. No rock from the foundation is consumed; the wall’s stone is created from nothing, but needs existing rock from which to emerge and with which to meld. The wall itself is one quarter of an inch thick for each level of the magic user and has an area of 20 × 20 ft per caster level. The wall need not be vertical, but must be anchored—a bridge is a good example of a way to create and use a horizontal wall of stone. The wall may be dispelled, but otherwise has all the characteristics of natural stone.",
magic_user,Water Breathing,3,touch,1 round/ level,One creature,v s m,3 segments,none,This spell grants the ability to breathe underwater while the spell lasts. The reverse of the spell allows a water-breathing creature to breathe in the air.,
magic_user,Web,2,5 ft/ level,2 turns/ level,80 cubic ft between anchoring points,v s m,2 segments,see text,"This spell causes a mass of tough, sticky webs to appear, filling in any open spaces where the webs can be anchored on both sides (floor and ceiling, between walls, etc.), up to the maximum of the spell’s area of effect. Any creature in the area must make a saving throw at a penalty of –2. The effect of a successful saving throw depends upon how close the target is to the edge of the area of effect; if the creature is within five ft of the edge of the spell’s area of effect, the creature has jumped free and is not affected by the web. If the creature is not within five ft of the edge and makes its save, that creature will be able to fight its way through the web at twice normal speed (at a rate of 1 ft per turn if its strength is less than 13) and will have no chance of suffocating. No creature within the area of effect, whether a saving throw is made or not, can cast spells or attack. Any creature that fails its saving throw has a cumulative 5% chance of suffocating per turn. Creatures with a strength of less than 13 that fail the saving throw are trapped within the web and cannot move or act at all. Creatures with a strength of 13-17 are capable of moving through 1 ft of webs per turn. A creature with strength 18+ can move through the web at a rate of 10 ft per turn, and creatures such as dragons virtually ignore the webs, breaking through at a rate of 100 ft per turn. The strands of a web spell are very flammable. If they are ignited, fire will flash through the entire web, dealing 2d4 points of damage to all creatures within and burning away the webs.",
magic_user,Wish,9,unlimited,Varies (GM discretion),Varies (GM discretion),v,Varies (GM discretion),Varies (GM discretion),"A wish spell is the true version of limited wish, an extraordinarily potent invocation of eldritch power. After casting a wish spell, the caster will be weakened considerably, requiring 2d4 days of bed rest. The only exception to this is when the wish is used for transport, healing, or resurrection of the dead. In general, the exact wording of the wish is carried out regardless of its intent, but the GM will not normally be stringent upon this point unless the wish is an attempt to overreach the spell’s power. In the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails. The guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters. The more greedy or selfish a wish, the greater the chance that a mischievous or actually evil power will take the opportunity to teach this upstart mortal a lesson.",
magic_user,Wizard Eye,4,caster,1 round/ level,Magical eye,v s m,1 turn,none,"The wizard eye is a scrying spell allowing the wizard to create a material (but invisible) visual organ that transmits to the caster whatever it sees. The eye has infravision with a range of 100 ft and can see at a distance of 600 ft in normal lighting. The eye travels at a rate of 30 ft per round if it is not scrutinising its surroundings closely, but can proceed no faster than 10 ft per round if it is examining floors, ceilings, and walls. The magic user can detect secret doors through the eye as per his or her normal chance, but cannot view through the eye with any special vision the magic user has, for the eye’s vision is limited to its own sensory capabilities. The eye cannot pass through solid substances, but it can move through a hole no more than an inch in diameter.",
magic_user,Wizard Lock,2,touch,permanent,30 square ft/ level,v s,2 segments,none,"A wizard lock spell functions similarly to a powerful hold portal spell, except that extra-dimensional creatures cannot pass through a wizard lock as they can a held portal.",
magic_user,Write,1,caster,1 hour/ level,caster,v s m,1 round,none,"This spell enables the magic user to make a written copy of a spell he or she cannot yet cast, a somewhat dangerous proposition. In order to succeed in this task, the caster must make a saving throw vs spells, with a modifier determined by the difficulty of the spell being transcribed. If the spell is up to one level higher than the magic user can cast, the saving throw is made at +2. If the spell is two levels higher than the magic user can cast, there is no bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the spell is more than 2 levels higher than the magic user can cast, each additional level adds a –1 penalty. If the magic user fails this saving throw, the spell is not successfully copied, the caster takes 1d4 points of damage for each level of the spell, and he or she is knocked unconscious for 1 turn per hit point sustained thereby. The damage sustained cannot be healed more quickly than 4 hp per day, even with the assistance of magical healing. If the saving throw is successful, the magic user may copy the spell, which takes one hour per level of the spell. The material component is ink costing at least 200 gp.",
