cleric,Aerial Servant ,6,10 ft,1 day/ caster lvl,See text,v s,9 segments,none,"By casting this spell, the cleric summons an aerial servant to do his or her bidding. The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth. When fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.",
cleric,Animate Dead ,3,10 ft,Permanent,See text,v s m,1 round,none,"By casting this spell, the cleric calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confi nes of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level.",
cleric,Animate Object ,6,30 ft,1 round/caster lvl,1 cubic ft/caster lvl,v s,9 segments,none,"By means of this spell, the cleric “brings to life” an inanimate object, allowing it to move and follow the cleric’s simple commands. The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/ round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.",
cleric,Astral Spell,7,Touch,See text,See text,v s,3 turns,none,"Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form. Most magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.",
cleric,Atonement ,5,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),1 person,v s m,1 turn,none,"The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.",
cleric,Augury,2,Caster,Instantaneous,Caster,v s m,2 rounds,none,"Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.",
cleric,Blade Barrier,6,30 ft,3 rounds/caster lvl,Circular path 2-10 ft in radius,v s,9 segments,none,"This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).",
cleric,Bless,1,60 ft,6 rounds,50 x 50 ft,v s m,1 round,none,"This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with -5% morale and -1 to hit.
The spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).",
cleric,Chant,2,0,Indefinite (duration of chant),30 ft radius centered around the caster,v s,1 turn,none,"Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a -1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.",
cleric,Command,1,10 ft,1 round,1 living creature,v,1 segment,See text,"By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”. Creatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.",
cleric,Commune,5,Caster,3 rounds (limited number of questions),See text,v s m,1 turn,none,"The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.",
cleric,Conjure Animals,6,30 ft,2 rounds/caster lvl,Conjured Creatures,v s,9 segments,none,"A cleric may use this spell to conjure animal allies from thin air and order them into combat. The total hit dice of summoned animals cannot exceed the cleric’s level, and the animals must all be of the same type. This spell will only summon mammals, although giant or prehistoric forms of normal mammals may be conjured if these are present within a few miles of the caster. The GM determines the specific type of animal that appears.",
cleric,Continual Light,3,120 ft,Permanent,60 ft radius globe,v s,6 segments,See text,"This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost sufficient to rival the light of day. In some respects the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light, but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a light spell,

extending 60 ft into the darkness. The reverse of the spell, continual darkness, produces an ink-like darkness in the same 60 ft area and negates the illumination of a continual light spell if one is present.
By casting the spell upon an enemy’s eyes or other organs of sight, the caster may blind the spell’s subject, causing the same penalties as if the creature were blinded by a light spell. In this instance, a saving throw is permitted, and if it is successful the spell’s effect will centre upon the area immediately behind the targeted creature.",
cleric,Control Weather,7,0,4d12 hours,4d4 square miles,v s m,1 turn,none,"The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather for several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather. This spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.",
cleric,Create Food and Water,3,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),A day’s ration per caster level,v s,1 turn,none,"Upon completion of the ritual words of this spell, food and/ or water will appear from thin air. A caster of fifth level can conjure up enough food and water to sustain a person or even a horse for five full days. The volume of food and water produced by the spell is approximately one cubic ft per level of the caster.",
cleric,Create Water,1,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),Up to 30 cubic ft,v s m,1 round,none,"This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water.",
cleric,Cure Blindness,3,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 round,none (Neg.),"This powerful spell allows the cleric permanently to remove virtually all forms of blindness. The reverse of the spell permits a saving throw, and the cleric must successfully touch the spell’s intended target to inflict blindness (permanent duration).",
cleric,Cure Critical Wounds,5,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,8 segments,none (Neg.),"This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of
damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.
",
cleric,Cure Disease,3,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 turn,none (Neg.),"By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.
",
cleric,Cure Light Wounds,1,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,5 segments,none (Neg.),"Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.",
cleric,Cure Serious Wounds,4,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),one creature,v s,7 segments,none (Neg.),"A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.",
cleric,Detect Charm,2,30 ft,1 turn,See text,v s,1 round,none,"This spell reveals to the cleric whether a creature is subject to a charm spell. The spell’s magic can discern a charm (or lack thereof) on up to ten creatures. The reverse of the spell conceals the existence of a charm, but affects only one creature.",
cleric,Detect Evil,1,Caster,1 turn + 5 rounds/lvl,"path 10 ft wide, 120 ft long",v s m,1 round,none,"This spell allows the cleric to discern emanations of evil (or good, in the case of the spell’s reverse) within the spell’s area of effect, a beam-like pathway. The spell detects evil, not danger, so it will be useless to discover such things as a mindless trap or a poisoned wineglass. Neither will it detect a cursed item unless the nature of the curse is such that the cursed item becomes inherently evil. ",
cleric,Detect Lie,4,30 ft,1 round/ caster lvl,One person,v s m,7 segments,none,"The subject of this spell (not necessarily the caster) gains the ability to discern whether the truth is being told, for the duration of the spell. The reverse of the spell allows the spell recipient’s most brazen falsehoods to seem logical and believable. The spell’s reverse may also be used to ward against the effects of a detect lie spell.",
cleric,Detect Magic,1,Caster,1 turn,"path 10 ft wide, 30 ft long",v s m,1 round,none,"Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.",
cleric,Dispel Evil,5,Touch,1 round/caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,8 segments,See text,"This spell banishes summoned creatures of evil, or those summoned for evil purposes, to their home planes of existence. Although a saving throw negates the spell’s banishing effect, any creature that would otherwise have been banished will suffer a penalty of -7 to hit the caster for the extent of the spell’s duration. Creatures affected by this spell include, but are certainly not limited to, afreets, demons, devils, genies (either evil or working toward evil purposes under duress), and elementals summoned for evil purposes. The reverse of the spell has the same effects, but upon summoned creatures of good alignment or those summoned for the purposes of good.",
cleric,Dispel Magic,3,60 ft,Instantaneous,30 ft radius sphere,v s,6 segments,none,"Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become nonoperational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility) will be dispelled.

With respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area. ",
cleric,Divination,4,Caster,See text,Caster,v s m,1 turn,none,"A divination spell gives the caster divine insight about a particular place, examples being a ruined castle, a particular region in a dungeon, or a small vale. The location of the place must be known to the cleric (e.g., the “Red Mausoleum,” if a legendary location, cannot be the focus of the spell, but if the cleric has seen the doorway of the tomb, the spell will be effective). The spell yields rich information compared to an augury, although it may be couched in rather vague and approximate terms.

The spell reveals the relative power of the creatures in the area, the treasure (“low,” “moderate,” or “rich”), and chances of incurring the wrath of gods or similar beings if the place is disturbed. There is a chance that the cleric will fail to interpret the omens properly; the base chance to succeed in gaining truthful information is 60%, and rises by another 1% per caster level. The chance may also be adjusted by the GM as necessary.

If the cleric’s reading of the omens is not correct, of course, he or she will be operating on completely false and useless “insights.” The casting of a divination spell is quite dramatic, involving the sacrifice of a dove or other such creature appropriate to the religion in question. Valuable items may also be sacrificed, and such may increase the chance of the cleric receiving clear omens that are easily interpreted.",
cleric,Earthquake,7,120 ft,1 round,5 ft diameter/lvl,v s m,1 turn,none,"The cleric invokes a small but intensely powerful earthquake within this spell’s area of effect. The spell may be used to create landslides, drain marshes, cave in tunnels, and collapse buildings. Yawning cracks in the earth have a good chance to swallow creatures in the area: the chance of falling into such a crevice (by creature size) is 1 in 4 (small), 1 in 6 (medium) and 1 in 8 (large). Being swallowed up in such fashion is, of course, fatal. Trees standing in the area of an earthquake spell have a 1 in 3 chance of being uprooted.",
cleric,Exorcise,4,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),One creature or object,v s m,See text,none,"Exorcism is a powerful abjuration that casts out demons, devils, or any supernatural inhabitant or influence from a creature or object that has been possessed or otherwise controlled. Exorcism banishes all charms and enchantments, removes curses, and will cast any possessing demon or other creature back into its nearest physical body other than the one being exorcised. The base chance for the cleric to perform a successful exorcism is randomly determined on a d% if the GM has not previously assigned a specific number to represent the relative diffi culty of the exorcism. To the base chance is added a modifier of +1/-1 for each level of difference between the cleric’s caster level and the level or hit dice of the opposing supernatural force (determined by the GM in the case of supernatural forces with no stated level or HD). The cleric begins the exorcism, rolling a d% for each turn. If the cleric’s die roll is equal to or less than the modified chance of success, the exorcism is successful. The process cannot be halted once it has begun, and if the cleric is forced to pause before successfully casting out the supernatural force, the spell will fail.",

cleric,Find the Path,6,Touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,3 rounds,none,"This spell imbues one creature with an uncanny sense for the shortest route into or out of a chosen locale. The spell imparts only a visceral intuition of the right direction and shortest distance, so it is impossible to use the spell either to circumvent dangers or to draw a map. This spell may be used to escape from a maze spell (q.v.) in one round and will continue to function thereafter. The spell’s reverse makes a creature unable to make any significant movement beyond aimless wandering.",

Each creature caught within the flames will suffer 6d8 points of damage, halved if the creature makes a successful saving throw.",
cleric,Gate,7,30 ft,See text,One summoned creature,v s,5 segments,none,"A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and Irascible.",
cleric,Glyph of Warding,3,Touch,permanent (until discharged),25 square ft/ caster level,v s m,See text,See text,"The glyph of warding is a magically charged sigil or rune, scribed and enchanted to serve as the focal point of a powerful magical trap. The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, floor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defining what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics. The GM must determine what glyphs may be within the capabilities of such formidable individuals.",
cleric,Heal,6,Touch,Instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s,1 round,none (Neg.),"This spell affects the same general variety of creatures as the cure light wounds spell (q.v.), but it is necromancy on an entirely different level than the various cure spells. Heal removes all hit point damage with the exception of the last 1d4 points, removes blindness, cures disease, and will negates the effects of a feeblemind spell.

The cleric decides how many of his or her foes he or she will target with the spell. If there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –2; if two, each makes the saving throw at –1; and if the cleric seeks to hold three enemies, each makes its saving throw with no penalty. If a magic item or spell operates partially to negate the effects of paralysis, failing the save will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. Creatures affected by this spell include humans, demi-humans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. Persons held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.",

When the cleric utters the final words of the incantation, this focal point belches forth a massive cloud of stinging insects, which boils outward almost instantly to fill the spell’s area of effect. Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force, etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point.

The caster may extinguish the magical light at any time. The reverse of the spell, darkness, creates an area of utter darkness just as the light spell creates light, with the only distinction being that the darkness spell has half the duration of a light spell. If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense.

It is not necessary for the caster to have seen the precise object that the spell will locate: if the caster is familiar with ladders in general, he or she may cast the spell successfully to locate any ladder within the spell’s range. The spell is directional, requiring the cleric to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The cleric may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.)

Despite its name, the spell’s power is not limited to water; it can affect other non-living fl uid substances as well, including gases and materials slightly more viscous than water. The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the cleric. For example, a cleric of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 x 70 ft. The reverse of the spell raises water in an area of effect similar to that of lower water , but not to the same degree of height, returning water to its natural level plus one foot per caster level.",

An unwilling victim must be touched by the cleric in order for the cleric to send him or her to another plane, and a saving throw is also applicable. The casting of a plane shift spell provides one-way travel to the other plane; a second casting of the spell (or a similar spell of planar travel) is required in order to make the return journey.

The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extra-planar creatures regardless of alignment.

cleric,Raise Dead,5,30 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),one person,v s,1 round,See text,"The eerie, keening incantation of this spell calls a soul back from the afterlife, literally bringing the dead back to life. Elves, as they do not have souls, cannot be brought back to life in this manner, but humans, half-elves, half-orcs, gnomes, dwarfs, and halflings can all be raised from the dead by means of this spell. The longer a soul has been departed from the material plane, the more difficult it is to call it back; a cleric can summon back a soul that has been dead no more days than the cleric’s level. In other words, a cleric of tenth level can raise a person who has been dead no more than ten days, but an eleventh level cleric can raise a person who has been dead eleven days. The raised person must survive a system shock saving throw in order to return to life, and he or she will be unable to engage in strenuous activity (such as combat, study, or spell casting) for a period of time equal to one day for each day that he or she was dead.

Perhaps mercifully, the spell erases the returning character’s memory concerning any places his or her soul may have visited following death.

Raise dead can instantly destroy most kinds of corporeal undead creatures (exception: it does not destroy liches). Incorporeal undead, such as ghosts or spectres, are immune. This use is treated the same as the reverse of the spell in terms of saving throws and damage.

The reverse of the spell is referred to in hushed tones as slay living. The subject of this spell (which must be used with extreme caution by good clerics, lest their alignment be altered) is entitled to a saving throw, and if the throw fails, the subject dies.

The spell’s reverse, bestow curse, inflicts the subject with a magical curse, the exact nature of which is not entirely within the caster’s control.

With the GM’s agreement, the character may design a specifi c curse to use with this spell other than the random curse the spell normally unleashes.

Not necessarily all lost experience points are restored; an afflicted character will only regain enough experience points to regain the lost level, no more. A cleric can only restore a level lost within as many days as the cleric’s caster level. For example, a cleric of 12th level cannot restore an experience level lost 13 or more days prior to the casting of the spell. The spell’s reverse causes the target to lose one experience level. No saving throw applies, but a successful attack is required. In addition to restoring lost levels, the spell can affect other sorts of magically-induced debilities.

It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power.

druid,Conjure Earth Elemental,7,40 ft,1 turn/ lvl,-,v s m,1 turn,none,"By means of this spell, the druid summons a 16 HD elemental from the plane of earth. The spell is otherwise identical to the druidic spell conjure fire elemental, but there is no chance to summon a more powerful elemental, as exists when a druid summons fire elementals. As with conjuring fire elementals, the earth elemental will be the druid’s ally by its own will; the druid requires no magical wards against it and need not concentrate upon it after the summoning is complete.",
druid,Conjure Fire Elemental,6,80 ft,1 turn/ caster lvl,-,v s m,6 rounds,none,"It is within the power of a high-level druid to summon forth an elemental being from the plane of fire. The elemental will ordinarily be of 16 HD, but there is a 5% chance that it will be of 24 HD and a 1% chance that an afreet, rather than an elemental, will appear. The elemental will act as the druid’s ally, remaining for the spell’s duration to assist him or her however possible, including engaging in combat with his or her enemies. Druids need no protective circle to summon fire elementals and need not concentrate upon the elemental in any way.",
druid,Control Temperature 10 ft radius,4,caster,4 turns + 1 turn/ lvl,10 ft radius,v s m,6 segments,none,"By casting this spell, the druid magically controls the temperature of his or her immediate surroundings, to a radius of 10 ft. The temperature may be raised or lowered by 9° Fahrenheit (4° Celsius) per caster level.",
druid,Control Weather,7,0,8d12 hours,4d8 sq miles,v s m,1 turn,none,"The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather of several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell, but druids are able to cause more of a change than druids can with the same spell; effectively twice the amount of change is possible for a druid. The druid could not bring heavy rain forth on a clear day, but could change the weather from clear to partly cloudy, and then to fully cloudy (with light rain, perhaps), all in the course of one casting. By comparison, a druid would only have been able to bring about partial clouds. Hot weather can be made cool, and a strong wind can be raised from calm air. This spell may be cast more than once in succession to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a strong wind, then from the strong wind to a full-scale storm.",
druid,Control Winds,5,caster,1 turn/ caster lvl,40 ft radius/ lvl,v s m,7 segments,none,"By the power of this spell, the druid can increase or decrease the force of the winds. For every caster level, the druid may change the speed of the wind by 3 miles per hour. An eye of calm with a radius of 40 ft remains around the druid and travels with him or her. The wind force increases (or decreases) at a rate of 3 miles per hour every round until the end of the spell’s duration, at which time it will return to normal, also at a rate of 3 miles per hour per turn. Winds can be extremely destructive; ships are at great risk of sinking if wind speed reaches 60 miles per hour, and wind speeds of 75+ mph are as a full-fledged hurricane.",
druid,Create Water,2,10 ft,Instantaneous (permanent),up to 1 ft cu/ lvl,v s,1 turn,none,"This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see.",
druid,Creeping Doom,7,0,4 rounds/ lvl,,v s m,9 segments,none,"The terrifying creeping doom spell causes a massive swarm of insects, spiders, and centipedes to boil forth from the ground in front of the caster, marching in whatever direction he or she orders, destroying and killing all that stands in their way. The swarm is composed of (1d6+4) x100 non-flying vermin, each of which inflicts 1 hp damage against an opponent before dying. Only as many insects as are needed to kill an opponent will die, and once the target is dead the swarm will move on. If the druid allows the swarm to get more than 80 ft away from his or her person, 50 insects for every 10 ft beyond this range will depart the swarm. The druid can order the swarm to attack specific targets and/or to change direction. Although the spell can be devastating (potentially causing as much as 1,000 hp of damage in total), many means can be used to counter it—the most obvious being a fireball or other area-of-effect damage spell.",
druid,Cure Critical Wounds,6,touch,instantaneous (permanent),one creature,v s m,8 segments,none,"This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.",
druid,Cure Disease,3,touch,instantaneous (permanent),Creature touched,v s m,1 round,none (neg.),"By means of this spell, the druid may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the druid successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.",
druid,Cure Light Wounds,2,touch,instantaneous (permanent),creature touched,v s m,4 segments,none (neg.),"Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.",
druid,Cure Serious Wounds,4,touch,instantaneous (permanent),creature touched,v s m,6 segments,none (neg.),"A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.",
druid,Detect Magic,1,caster,12 rounds,"path 10 ft wide, 40 ft long",v s m,3 segments,none,"Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.",
druid,Detect Pits and Snares,1,caster,4 rounds/ lvl,"path 10 ft wide, 40 ft long",v s m,3 segments,none,"The druid may cast this spell upon himor herself, imbuing his or her eyes with divinatory power. The druid can instantly discern virtually any form of trap if outdoors, and even indoors or underground he or she will detect the presence of pits.",
druid,Dispel Magic,4,80 ft,instantaneous,40 ft cu/ lvl,v s m,6 segments,none,"Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become nonoperational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility) will be dispelled. With respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area.",
druid,Entangle,1,80 ft,1 turn,20 ft radius,v s m,3 segments,Half (see desc),"The druid casts this spell upon a particular spot, whereupon all plants in a 20 ft radius of the enchanted location immediately begin to writhe violently about, whipping around and entangling any creature in the area. Creatures threatened in this manner are entitled to a saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature’s movement rate is slowed to half normal; if the saving throw fails, the creature is so securely held in the plants that it cannot move, attack, or cast spells for the duration of the spell.",
druid,Faerie Fire,1,80 ft,4 rounds/ caster lvl,1 size M or 2 size S creatures/ caster lvl,v,3 segments,none,"The druid uses this spell to ignite a fiery-looking aura of bright light around his or her enemies. The aura is visible at a range of 80 ft if the observer stands in darkness, and at 40 ft if he or she stands near another light source. The light itself is harmless, but a creature limned with faerie fire is easier to hit; any attacks against it are made with a bonus of +2.",
druid,Feeblemind,6,40 ft,permanent,one creature,v s,8 segments,negates,"The insidious feeblemind spell affects only those who can cast spells, tracing and poisoning the mystical channels of their arcane power like a viral infection. The spell reduces a victim into a state of extreme mental retardation, which condition persists until the victim is magically restored by means of a heal, wish, or restoration spell. The different types of spell casting ability are not equally vulnerable to the feeblemind spell. Practitioners of clerical magic gain a bonus of +1 to saving throws; druids save at –1; magic users and illusionists save at –4. (Those who can use more than one type of magic must save using the average of their modifiers.)",
druid,Feign Death,2,10 ft,4 rounds + 2 rounds/ lvl,one creature,v s m,3 segments,none,"This spell magically slows the recipient’s metabolism into a state so close to death that it is impossible to distinguish the enspelled person from a corpse by any means other than magical. The recipient can hear, smell, and think; the senses of touch and sight no longer function. Damage caused to the pseudocorpse is reduced by one half, and the spell’s recipient will not even know that the damage has been caused—potentially a dangerous situation. A person under the influence of this spell is not subject to level draining by the undead and will not be affected by poisons until the spell wears off or is otherwise removed; the caster can remove the catalepsy at will, and the spell is subject to being dispelled.",
druid,Finger of Death,7,60 ft,instantaneous,one creature,v s m,5 segments,negates,"The casting of this spell culminates when the druid points a finger at his or her chosen victim. If the target fails a saving throw, it dies.",
druid,Fire Seeds,6,40 ft (see text),1 turn/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,1 round/ seed,half,"By casting this spell upon a group of seeds, either acorns or holly berries, the druid imbues them with the potential to erupt in a violent explosion of magical fire. Transformed acorns may be used as missiles, and transformed holly berries as delayed-action bombs. The spell allows the druid to create four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds, or a proportionate combination such as two acorns and four holly berries. Acorns may be thrown at a range of up to 40 ft and cause 2d8 points of damage in a radius of 5 ft, igniting any combustibles that fail item saving throws. If an acorn strikes its target with a successful to-hit roll, the target is not entitled to a saving throw. Even if the attack misses, the target may be caught in the blast area (and would be entitled to a saving throw for half damage, as any other creature within the blast area). The holly berries may be thrown no more than 6 ft, or may be left in place to ignite upon a command word. (The range of the command word is 40 ft.) Holly berries create an explosion in an area of 5 x 5 ft, inflicting 1d8 points of damage and causing combustible items to make saving throws against magical fire or burn. As with the acorn seeds, a successful saving throw against the explosion of a holly berry fire seed reduces the damage inflicted by one-half.",
druid,Fire Storm,7,150 ft,1 round,20 x 20 x 20 ft area/ caster lvl,v s m,9 segments,half,"The fire storm invocation is a modified and enlarged version of wall of fire. It lasts for only a single round, and does only half the damage of a wall of fire (i.e. 2d8 damage), but the huge area of effect makes it devastating. The spell’s reverse extinguishes all normal fire in the area of effect, or will instantly kill one fire elemental (no saving throw).",
druid,Fire Trap,2,touch,permanent until tripped,one object,v s m,1 turn,Half,"This spell enchants any item that can be opened or closed with a magical trap. When the item is opened by any person other than the caster, magical fire explodes in an area five ft in radius around the fire trapped object, causing 1d4 plus the caster’s level hit points of damage to all creatures in this area. A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion. Detecting a fire trap is extraordinarily difficult; attempts to find traps are reduced by one-half in efficacy if the trap is a fire trap, and the trap will detonate if an attempt to remove traps fails.",
druid,Hallucinatory Forest,4,touch,instantaneous,3 cu ft + 1/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"The magic user moulds stone by the power of his or her will, shaping it into whatever object or form he or she desires, from a weapon to a sculpture to an ornate stone footstool. Whether used to decorate the wizard’s tower with gargoyles or to make an escape hole from a stone prison, this spell is extremely versatile and useful.",
druid,Heat Metal,2,40 ft,7 rounds,"All metal worn by 1 size M creature per caster lvl, or 50lbs weight/ caster lvl, as applicable",v s m,4 segments,none,"This extremely powerful spell causes metal to heat up to searing temperatures, and the reverse, chill metal, causes metal to become damagingly cold. The two versions of the spell inflict different damage and potential side effects.

druid,Hold Animal,3,0,2 rounds/ caster lvl,1d4 animals,v s m,5 segments,negates,"By means of this spell the druid holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, or reptiles, but not monsters such as centaurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. That is, apes, bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant beavers, and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for 2 melee rounds per level of experience of the druid casting it. It is up to the druid as to how many animals he or she wishes to hold with the spell, but the greater the number, the better chance each will have of not being affected by the spell. Note that a maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds with respect to non-mammals)/animal/level of experience of the druid can be affected, i.e. an 8th level druid can affect up to four 3,200 pound mammals or a like number of 800 pound non-mammals such as birds or reptiles. Each animal gets a saving throw: if only 1 is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its die roll to save; if 2 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -2 on their die rolls; if 3 are subject, they each receive a penalty of -1 on their die rolls; if 4 are subject, each makes a normal saving throw.",
druid,Hold Plant,4,80 ft,1 round/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,6 segments,negates,"This spell affects plants that can move, whether naturally or as the result of a spell. Plants affected by the spell are frozen in place for the spell’s duration, and if the spell is cast upon normal vegetation (such as dry leaves), these will make no sound other than sounds caused by the wind. In the case of moulds, fungi, and other plants that cannot be considered separately, the spell affects 4-16 square yards of space, as decided by the druid. In the case of plant creatures such as treants, the spell affects between one and four creatures, at the caster’s option. Depending upon how many creatures (or sq yards of space) the druid targets, the saving throw against the spell is subject to different penalties. If one creature (4 sq yards) is targeted, the saving throw against the spell is made at a penalty of –4; two creatures or 8 sq yards suffer a penalty of –2; three creatures or 12 sq yards suffer a penalty of –1; and four creatures or 16 sq yards suffer no penalty on the saving throw.",
druid,Insect Plague,5,320 ft,1 turn/ caster lvl,"cloud of 160 ft radius, 40 ft high",v s m,7 segments,none,"While casting this spell, the druid designates a central point for the spell’s origin up to 360 ft from where he or she stands. When the druid utters the final words of the incantation, this focal point belches forth a massive cloud of stinging insects, which boils outward almost instantly to fill the spell’s area of effect. Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force, etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point. Even a fireball or flame strike will do nothing other than temporarily (1 turn) to clear the insects out of the area affected by their flames.",
druid,Invisibility to Animals,1,touch,1 turn + 1 round/lvl,Creature touched,s m,4 segments,none,"With a gesture, the druid or other recipient of the spell fades from the sight, sound, and smell of any animal (i.e. creature listed under “Animal” in Chapter V). Creatures with intelligence of 6+ are not affected by the spell. This powerful form of invisibility is not dispelled if the druid attacks, although a particular creature being attacked with a hand-held weapon will, of course, be aware of the druid’s general location and be entitled to attack with a –4 penalty until the druid moves out of its immediate area. Druids will, by nature of their calling, not use this spell to commit wholesale slaughter upon animals except in extraordinary circumstances.",
druid,Locate Animals,1,caster,1 round/ caster lvl,"Path 20 ft wide, 20 ft/ caster lvl long",v s m,1 round,none,"The caster becomes able to divine the presence of a particular kind of animal in the direction he or she views. The druid must concentrate for a full round in a particular direction in order to gain the insight granted by the spell. The spell’s enchantment affects the caster, so the effects move with him or her. The divination is not blocked by any intervening substance, of any thickness.",
druid,Locate Plants,2,Caster,1 turn/ caster lvl,5 ft radius/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"When this spell is used by a druid, he or she is able to locate any desired type of plant within the area of effect. Note: the plant type must be singular and concentrated upon. The spell's area of effect centres on, and moves with, the druid.",
druid,Neutralise Poison,3,touch,instantaneous,Creature touched,v s,5 segments,none (neg.),"By means of a Neutralize Poison spell, the druid detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or substance touched. Note that an opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched requires the druid to score a hit in melee combat. Effects of the spell are permanent only with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch, i.e. creatures (or objects) which generate new poison will not be permanently detoxified. The reversed spell, Poison, likewise requires an attack (a ""to hit"" touch which succeeds), and the victim is allowed a saving throw versus poison. If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is killed by the poison.",
druid,Obscurement,2,0,4 rounds/ caster lvl,10 x 10 ft cube/ caster lvl,v s,4 segments,none,"As this spell is completed, an enchanted mist billows from the area where the druid stands, rapidly filling the area of effect and reducing visibility therein to 1d4 x2 ft. The spell is affected by natural conditions such as strong winds, which will reduce the spell’s effective duration.",
druid,Pass Plant,5,touch,see text,see text,v s m,7 segments,none,"By means of this spell, the druid steps into one tree and steps out from a distant tree of the same type. The druid determines the direction in which he or she will travel from one tree to another. Most trees permit a maximum distance of travel of 300 yards, but trees sacred to druids allow travel of considerably greater distance; oak, yew, and rowan trees permit the druid to travel as far as 600 yards. If no tree of the same type is to be found in the direction the druid designates, he or she will emerge from any tree of that species within the spell’s range closest to the direction he or she specified. The druid may remain in the first tree for as long as one round per caster level before being forced to leave the other tree, and in this case he or she will be treated in the same way as for a plant door spell. If no appropriate tree is available for the druid to step from, he or she may remain in the first tree for the spell’s duration, but will not be able to use the spell for travelling.",
druid,Pass Without Trace,1,touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,Creature touched,v s m,1 round,none,"Any creature upon which this spell is cast can move through any sort of terrain without leaving behind the slightest sign of its passage. It leaves no footprints, no scent, and no other telltales of movement. It is impossible to trace its path except, temporarily, by one method—the path will radiate magic for 6d6 turns. Once this time elapses, the magical aura will fade away, leaving the trail undisturbed by any sign that the spell’s recipient was ever there.",
druid,Plant Door,4,touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,6 segments,none,"This spell allows the druid to travel effortlessly through vegetation of any kind, stepping through it as if it did not exist.

The pathway opened by the spell may be up to 5 ft wide, 10 ft high, and up to 120 ft/ caster level in length. The druid may even use the spell to shift inside a tree or move through an area of plants affected by a spell (such as entangle). If the druid is within a tree that is attacked, he or she must leave the tree before it is killed or die with the tree.",
druid,Plant Growth,3,160 ft,permanent,20 x 20 ft sq/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"By means of this spell, the druid causes plants and vines to grow with unbelievable speed, forming a tangled barrier of thick vegetation. The enchantment may be dispelled, or the plants cleared by normal means. Chopping a way through the barrier is possible, but movement is restricted to 10 ft/ turn (20 ft for size L creatures).",
druid,Predict Weather,1,0,instantaneous,9 square miles,v s m,1 round,none,"The druid casts this spell upon virtually any substance: bones, leaves, powders, etc. He or she can read in the resulting pattern an exact divination of the weather as it will naturally occur with-in the surrounding nine square miles for the next two hours per caster level.

It can be used to set fires and may also be thrown as a missile. The throwing range of the flame is 40 ft, and when the flame hits an object it will explode, igniting all combustible material in a radius of 15 ft.

druid,Protection From Fire,3,touch,see text,one creature,v s m,5 segments,none,"The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from fire upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon himor herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to fires of magical nature, such as dragon’s breath. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal fire and a saving throw bonus of +4 against fire based attacks. Any damage incurred by fire attacks will also reduced by half. If the spell is cast upon the druid, he or she becomes completely invulnerable to normal fire and also ignores all damage from magical fire (dragon breath, fireball, etc.) until a total of 12 hp/caster level has been absorbed by the spell, at which time the spell will be dissipated.",
druid,Protection From Lightning,4,touch,see text,one creature,v s m,6 segments,none,"This spell lends the recipient the same protection against lightning and electricity as the third level spell protection from fire affords against fire: The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from lightning upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon himor herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to lightning or electricity of a magical nature. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal lightning and a saving throw bonus of +4 against lightning based attacks.

druid,Purify Water,1,40 ft,instantaneous,1 cubic ft/ caster lvl,v s,1 round,n,"This spell removes all impurities from water, making it clear and drinkable. The reverse of the spell contaminates water, making it impossible to drink, and will negate the properties of holy and unholy water.",
druid,Pyrotechnics,3,160 ft,see text,see text,v s m,5 segments,none,"The pyrotechnics spell may be used to produce two entirely different effects: a bright display of fiery light or a massive pall of smoke. Both possible uses of the spell require an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell’s range), and the spell’s area of effect depends on the size of the originating fire. If the spell is used to produce fireworks, the flashing display will temporarily blind (for 1d4+1 rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond—provided that the display is not obstructed from view, of course. The fireworks fill an area ten times the volume of the original fire source and persist for 1 segment/ caster level. If the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft in an area 100 times the volume of the fire source.

druid,Shillelagh,1,touch,permanent (until triggered),10 ft radius + 6 ft/ caster lvl,v s m,3 rounds,none,"The druid imbues a club or billet of oak-wood with enchanted power, making it +1 to hit and capable of inflicting 2d4 points of damage against small and medium-sized opponents, 1d4+1 against large opponents. The shillelagh must be wielded by the druid in order for it to possess these magical properties; in the hands of any other person it will be no more than an ordinary wooden club.",
druid,Snare,3,touch,permanent (until triggered),10 ft radius + 6 ft/ caster lvl,v s m,3 rounds,none,"This spell is used to enchant a normal snare, making it hard to detect and supernaturally effective. The spell is cast upon a rope, vine, or cord, which then blends perfectly with the surroundings, becoming 90% undetectable to normal (unenchanted) vision. When any creature steps into the area bounded by the snare, the snare will whip closed and bind the victim tightly. Strength of 23 is required to break the snare for one hour after the spell is triggered, and the strength required falls by one point per hour until 12 hours have elapsed, at which time the spell ceases to have any effect. If the snare is attached to a suitably flexible tree, the spell will magically bend the tree so that when the trap is triggered it will snap the victim into the air for 1d6 points of damage and hold it suspended from the branches.",
druid,Speak with Animals,1,0,2 rounds/ caster lvl,One animal type within 40ft of caster,v s,3 segments,non,"This spell allows the druid to speak with all animals of a particular type or species that are within 40 ft of him or her when the spell’s casting is complete. In all other respects, except as denoted above, the spell is identical to the second level cleric spell speak with animals.",
druid,Speak with Plants,4,caster,2 rounds/ caster lvl,40 ft radius around caster,v s m,1 turn,none,"The druid becomes able to hold converse with living plant matter. He or she may pose questions and understand the answers given, although any conclusions or opinions the plant provides will be based on the plant’s level of intelligence. Even a normal plant, however, will be able to convey information about events that have transpired near it. If the plants are capable of motion, it will be possible for the druid to persuade them into a course of action, such as drawing aside to allow passage, or even attacking an enemy citadel.",
druid,Sticks to Snakes,5,40 ft,2 rounds/ caster lvl,5 ft radius,v s m,7 segments,none,"This spell enables the druid to transform sticks into serpents that attack at the druid’s will. The snakes may be ordered to take other actions if the druid can speak with them, but this spell alone does not grant the power to communicate with the snakes, only to will them to attack particular opponents. The spell transforms one stick per caster level, and each snake has a 5% chance per caster level of being venomous. The reverse of the spell will change snakes into harmless sticks and can work such a transformation upon snakes created by means of this spell. Sticks of a magical quality, such as wands or magic spears, are not affected by the spell.",
druid,Stone Shape,3,touch,instantaneous,3 cu ft + 1/ caster lvl,v s m,1 round,none,"The druid moulds stone by the power of his or her will, shaping it into whatever object or form he or she desires, from a weapon to a sculpture to an ornate stone footstool. Whether used to decorate the wizard’s tower with gargoyles or to make an escape hole from a stone prison, this spell is extremely versatile and useful.",
druid,Summon Insects,3,30 ft,1 round/ caster lvl,see text,v s m,1 round,none,"When the druid completes the intonations and gestures of this spell, a swarm of insects appears from nearby or from the thin air to attack the druid’s enemies. There is a 70% chance that the swarm will be composed of flying insects, 30% chance that the insects will be ants or other non-airborne biting vermin. A flying swarm can move tremendously fast, but a crawling swarm is limited to movement of 12 ft/ round. In either case, the insects automatically inflict 2 hp damage per round against their target, and the unfortunate victim will be so thickly covered as to be incapable of any action, including movement. The druid may redirect the swarm to attack another opponent, but the command will cause 1 round of confusion within the swarm as it reorients itself toward the new target.",
druid,Transmute Metal to Wood,7,80 ft,instantaneous (permanent),one metal object,v s m,9 segments,see text,"Using this spell, the druid may select a single object of metal and change its substance to wood. The spell affects up to 8 lbs of metal per caster level. The item is not entitled to a saving throw, but magic items have a flat 90% chance of being unaffected by the spell.",
druid,Transmute Rock to Mud,5,160 ft,see text,20 ft cube/ caster lvl,v s m,7 segments,none,"This spell transforms solid rock into mud, the volume transformed being proportionate to the caster’s level. Any volume of mud will sink until its depth is equal to about one half the pool’s diameter. If this spell is cast upon a ceiling, the resulting volume of mud will immediately collapse, possibly trapping or suffocating those caught beneath. Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed). The spell’s reverse transforms mud into sandstone or a similar sedimentary rock.",
druid,Transport via Plants,6,touch,see text,see text,v s,3 segments,none,"The mystic oneness of all nature is a principal tenet of many druidic sects, and it sees practical use in the transport via plants spell. Upon casting this spell, the druid may travel almost instantly from one plant to another through the mystic oneness that joins all life forms. The spell operates in much the same fashion as pass plant, but with an unlimited range. When the spell is cast, the druid simply steps into a large plant of any kind and disappears into it. He or she may remain in the first plant for up to 24 hours, but at any time he or she may step forth from another plant of the same species in another location. The druid may know of a specific plant from which he or she wants to emerge, or may simply specify a distance and a direction. If the druid does not know of a specific destination plant, his or her arrival may be off by 1d% miles from the desired point of arrival, at the GM’s discretion.",
druid,Tree,3,caster,6 turns + 1 turn/ caster lvl,caster,v s m,5 segments,none,"Casting this spell causes the druid’s shape to melt and twist into that of a tree, its general appearance determined by the caster. The spell is neither an illusion nor a charm: the druid is, for all intents and purposes, a tree. However, in tree shape the druid retains human senses and will be fully aware of his or her surroundings. The druid may shift back into human shape at will, thereby ending the spell. Magical detections will reveal the druid’s true form, but ordinary inspections, no matter how minute, will not.",
druid,Trip,2,touch,1 turn/ caster lvl,One 10 ft long object,v s m,5 segments,negates,"The spell caster must use a length of vine, a stick, pole, rope, or similar object to cast this magic upon. The Trip spell causes the object to rise slightly off the ground or floor it is resting on and trip creatures crossing it if they fail to make their saving throw versus magic. Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the magicked object, i.e. a 3' long piece of rope could trip only 1 man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped will take 1-6 (d6) hit points of damage and be stunned for 2-5 (d4+1) rounds if the surface they full upon is very hard, but if it is turf or non-hard they will merely be stunned for 2-5 segments. Very large creatures such as elephants will not be at all affected by a Trip. The object magicked will continue to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spell caster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures aware of the object and its potential add +4 to their saving throw when crossing it. The object is 80% undetectable without magical means of detection.",
druid,Turn Wood,6,0,4 rounds/ caster lvl,"120 ft wide path, 20 ft long/ caster lvl",v s m,8 segments,none,"At the completion of this spell, the druid holds his or her palm outstretched, and with the final word of the spell a tremendous burst of power rolls forth, forcing back all wooden objects. Even very large wooden structures that are not affixed to the ground will be affected, although objects fixed to the ground will manage to withstand the spell’s awesome power. A saplingsized or smaller piece of wood will splinter and break even if it is firmly affixed. The druid need not concentrate on maintaining the waves of force and cannot change the direction of the flow of eldritch power once it is set.",
druid,Wall of Fire,5,80 ft (wall) or caster (ring),see text,see text,v s m,7 segments,none,"One of the more dramatic examples of druidic magic is the wall of fire spell, by which the druid calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the shape of a wall. One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict.",
druid,Wall of Thorns,6,80 ft,1 turn/ lvl,100 ft cube/ caster lvl,v s,8 segments,none,"When the druid casts this spell, a tangled wall of briar vines erupts from the ground, bristling with sharp, deadly thorns. Running into or attempting to force a way through the thorns will cause 8 hp damage, plus 1 hp for every point of armour class. A creature may be caught within the wall of thorns when the spell is cast, and if this is the case it will take damage immediately and must fight through (taking damage a second time) to gain enough freedom of motion to chop at the thorns. It takes four turns to cut through a 40 ft thickness of a wall of thorns. Normal fire has no effect upon a wall of thorns, but magical fire can ignite the entire growth, creating a wall of fire (as per the spell) that burns away to nothing in two turns.",
druid,Warp Wood,2,10 ft/ caster lvl,instantaneous (permanent),See text,v s m,4 segments,none,"This spell permanently warps wood and may be used to destroy arrows, spears, doors, etc. The druid may affect a volume of wood roughly fifteen inches long by one inch thick per caster level, about the volume of an axe handle. Multiple items may be affected; four arrows have about the same volume as an axe handle. A fifth-level druid could effectively destroy a normal door with this spell.",
druid,Water Breathing,3,touch,6 turns/ lvl,one creature,v s m,5 segments,none,This spell grants the ability to breathe underwater while the spell lasts. The reverse of the spell allows a water-breathing creature to breathe in the air.,
druid,Weather Summoning,6,0,see text,see text,v s m,1 turn,none,"The area of effect of this spell is d% square miles, but except as noted above, the spell is similar to the clerical spell control weather, allowing the druid to affect, but not direct, existing weather conditions.",
